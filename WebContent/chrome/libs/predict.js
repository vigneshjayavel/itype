THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER BY MARK TWAIN Samuel Langhorne Clemens P R E F A C EMOST of the adventures recorded in this book really occurred one ortwo were experiences of my own the rest those of boys who wereschoolmates of mine. Huck Finn is drawn from life Tom Sawyer also butnot from an individual he is a combination of the characteristics ofthree boys whom I knew and therefore belongs to the composite order ofarchitecture.The odd superstitions touched upon were all prevalent among childrenand slaves in the West at the period of this story that is to saythirty or forty years ago.Although my book is intended mainly for the entertainment of boys andgirls I hope it will not be shunned by men and women on that accountfor part of my plan has been to try to pleasantly remind adults of whatthey once were themselves and of how they felt and thought and talkedand what queer enterprises they sometimes engaged in. THE AUTHOR.HARTFORD . T O M S A W Y E RCHAPTER ITOMNo answer.TOMNo answer.Whats gone with that boy I wonder You TOMNo answer.The old lady pulled her spectacles down and looked over them about theroom then she put them up and looked out under them. She seldom ornever looked THROUGH them for so small a thing as a boy they were herstate pair the pride of her heart and were built for style notservice she could have seen through a pair of stovelids just as well.She looked perplexed for a moment and then said not fiercely butstill loud enough for the furniture to hearWell I lay if I get hold of you Ill She did not finish for by this time she was bending down and punchingunder the bed with the broom and so she needed breath to punctuate thepunches with. She resurrected nothing but the cat.I never did see the beat of that boyShe went to the open door and stood in it and looked out among thetomato vines and jimpson weeds that constituted the garden. No Tom.So she lifted up her voice at an angle calculated for distance andshoutedYouu TOMThere was a slight noise behind her and she turned just in time toseize a small boy by the slack of his roundabout and arrest his flight.There I might a thought of that closet. What you been doing inthereNothing.Nothing Look at your hands. And look at your mouth. What IS thattruckI dont know aunt.Well I know. Its jam thats what it is. Forty times Ive said ifyou didnt let that jam alone Id skin you. Hand me that switch.The switch hovered in the air the peril was desperate My Look behind you auntThe old lady whirled round and snatched her skirts out of danger. Thelad fled on the instant scrambled up the high boardfence anddisappeared over it.His aunt Polly stood surprised a moment and then broke into a gentlelaugh.Hang the boy cant I never learn anything Aint he played me tricksenough like that for me to be looking out for him by this time But oldfools is the biggest fools there is. Cant learn an old dog new tricksas the saying is. But my goodness he never plays them alike two daysand how is a body to know whats coming He pears to know just howlong he can torment me before I get my dander up and he knows if hecan make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh its all downagain and I cant hit him a lick. I aint doing my duty by that boyand thats the Lords truth goodness knows. Spare the rod and spilethe child as the Good Book says. Im a laying up sin and suffering forus both I know. Hes full of the Old Scratch but lawsame hes myown dead sisters boy poor thing and I aint got the heart to lashhim somehow. Every time I let him off my conscience does hurt me soand every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Wellawell manthat is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble as theScripture says and I reckon its so. Hell play hookey this evening and Southwestern for afternoon Ill just be obleeged to make himwork tomorrow to punish him. Its mighty hard to make him workSaturdays when all the boys is having holiday but he hates work morethan he hates anything else and Ive GOT to do some of my duty by himor Ill be the ruination of the child.Tom did play hookey and he had a very good time. He got back homebarely in season to help Jim the small colored boy saw nextdayswood and split the kindlings before supper at least he was there intime to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did threefourths of thework. Toms younger brother or rather halfbrother Sid was alreadythrough with his part of the work picking up chips for he was aquiet boy and had no adventurous troublesome ways.While Tom was eating his supper and stealing sugar as opportunityoffered Aunt Polly asked him questions that were full of guile andvery deep for she wanted to trap him into damaging revealments. Likemany other simplehearted souls it was her pet vanity to believe shewas endowed with a talent for dark and mysterious diplomacy and sheloved to contemplate her most transparent devices as marvels of lowcunning. Said sheTom it was middling warm in school warnt itYesm.Powerful warm warnt itYesm.Didnt you want to go in aswimming TomA bit of a scare shot through Tom a touch of uncomfortable suspicion.He searched Aunt Pollys face but it told him nothing. So he saidNom well not very much.The old lady reached out her hand and felt Toms shirt and saidBut you aint too warm now though. And it flattered her to reflectthat she had discovered that the shirt was dry without anybody knowingthat that was what she had in her mind. But in spite of her Tom knewwhere the wind lay now. So he forestalled what might be the next moveSome of us pumped on our heads mines damp yet. SeeAunt Polly was vexed to think she had overlooked that bit ofcircumstantial evidence and missed a trick. Then she had a newinspirationTom you didnt have to undo your shirt collar where I sewed it topump on your head did you Unbutton your jacketThe trouble vanished out of Toms face. He opened his jacket. Hisshirt collar was securely sewed.Bother Well go long with you. Id made sure youd played hookeyand been aswimming. But I forgive ye Tom. I reckon youre a kind of asinged cat as the saying is bettern you look. THIS time.She was half sorry her sagacity had miscarried and half glad that Tomhad stumbled into obedient conduct for once.But Sidney saidWell now if I didnt think you sewed his collar with white threadbut its black.Why I did sew it with white TomBut Tom did not wait for the rest. As he went out at the door he saidSiddy Ill lick you for that.In a safe place Tom examined two large needles which were thrust intothe lapels of his jacket and had thread bound about them one needlecarried white thread and the other black. He saidShed never noticed if it hadnt been for Sid. Confound it sometimesshe sews it with white and sometimes she sews it with black. I wish togeeminy shed stick to one or tother I cant keep the run of em. ButI bet you Ill lam Sid for that. Ill learn himHe was not the Model Boy of the village. He knew the model boy verywell though and loathed him.Within two minutes or even less he had forgotten all his troubles.Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to himthan a mans are to a man but because a new and powerful interest borethem down and drove them out of his mind for the time just as mensmisfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. Thisnew interest was a valued novelty in whistling which he had justacquired from a negro and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed.It consisted in a peculiar birdlike turn a sort of liquid warbleproduced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at shortintervals in the midst of the music the reader probably remembers howto do it if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gavehim the knack of it and he strode down the street with his mouth fullof harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as anastronomer feels who has discovered a new planet no doubt as far asstrong deep unalloyed pleasure is concerned the advantage was withthe boy not the astronomer.The summer evenings were long. It was not dark yet. Presently Tomchecked his whistle. A stranger was before him a boy a shade largerthan himself. A newcomer of any age or either sex was an impressivecuriosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boywas well dressed too well dressed on a weekday. This was simplyastounding. His cap was a dainty thing his closebuttoned blue clothroundabout was new and natty and so were his pantaloons. He had shoeson and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie a bright bit ofribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Toms vitals. Themore Tom stared at the splendid marvel the higher he turned up hisnose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemedto him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved the other moved butonly sidewise in a circle they kept face to face and eye to eye allthe time. Finally Tom saidI can lick youId like to see you try it.Well I can do it.No you cant either.Yes I can.No you cant.I can.You cant.CanCantAn uncomfortable pause. Then Tom saidWhats your nameTisnt any of your business maybe.Well I low Ill MAKE it my business.Well why dont youIf you say much I will.Much much MUCH. There now.Oh you think youre mighty smart DONT you I could lick you withone hand tied behind me if I wanted to.Well why dont you DO it You SAY you can do it.Well I WILL if you fool with me.Oh yes Ive seen whole families in the same fix.Smarty You think youre SOME now DONT you Oh what a hatYou can lump that hat if you dont like it. I dare you to knock itoff and anybody thatll take a dare will suck eggs.Youre a liarYoure another.Youre a fighting liar and dasnt take it up.Aw take a walkSay if you give me much more of your sass Ill take and bounce arock offn your head.Oh of COURSE you will.Well I WILL.Well why dont you DO it then What do you keep SAYING you will forWhy dont you DO it Its because youre afraid.I AINT afraid.You are.I aint.You are.Another pause and more eying and sidling around each other. Presentlythey were shoulder to shoulder. Tom saidGet away from hereGo away yourselfI wont.I wont either.So they stood each with a foot placed at an angle as a brace andboth shoving with might and main and glowering at each other withhate. But neither could get an advantage. After struggling till bothwere hot and flushed each relaxed his strain with watchful cautionand Tom saidYoure a coward and a pup. Ill tell my big brother on you and hecan thrash you with his little finger and Ill make him do it too.What do I care for your big brother Ive got a brother thats biggerthan he is and whats more he can throw him over that fence too.Both brothers were imaginary.Thats a lie.YOUR saying so dont make it so.Tom drew a line in the dust with his big toe and saidI dare you to step over that and Ill lick you till you cant standup. Anybody thatll take a dare will steal sheep.The new boy stepped over promptly and saidNow you said youd do it now lets see you do it.Dont you crowd me now you better look out.Well you SAID youd do it why dont you do itBy jingo for two cents I WILL do it.The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them outwith derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boyswere rolling and tumbling in the dirt gripped together like cats andfor the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each others hair andclothes punched and scratched each others nose and coveredthemselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form andthrough the fog of battle Tom appeared seated astride the new boy andpounding him with his fists. Holler nuff said he.The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying mainly from rage.Holler nuff and the pounding went on.At last the stranger got out a smothered Nuff and Tom let him upand saidNow thatll learn you. Better look out who youre fooling with nexttime.The new boy went off brushing the dust from his clothes sobbingsnuffling and occasionally looking back and shaking his head andthreatening what he would do to Tom the next time he caught him out.To which Tom responded with jeers and started off in high feather andas soon as his back was turned the new boy snatched up a stone threwit and hit him between the shoulders and then turned tail and ran likean antelope. Tom chased the traitor home and thus found out where helived. He then held a position at the gate for some time daring theenemy to come outside but the enemy only made faces at him through thewindow and declined. At last the enemys mother appeared and calledTom a bad vicious vulgar child and ordered him away. So he wentaway but he said he lowed to lay for that boy.He got home pretty late that night and when he climbed cautiously inat the window he uncovered an ambuscade in the person of his auntand when she saw the state his clothes were in her resolution to turnhis Saturday holiday into captivity at hard labor became adamantine inits firmness.CHAPTER IISATURDAY morning was come and all the summer world was bright andfresh and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart and ifthe heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer inevery face and a spring in every step. The locusttrees were in bloomand the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill beyondthe village and above it was green with vegetation and it lay just farenough away to seem a Delectable Land dreamy reposeful and inviting.Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and alonghandled brush. He surveyed the fence and all gladness left him anda deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of boardfence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow and existence but aburden. Sighing he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmostplank repeated the operation did it again compared the insignificantwhitewashed streak with the farreaching continent of unwhitewashedfence and sat down on a treebox discouraged. Jim came skipping out atthe gate with a tin pail and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water fromthe town pump had always been hateful work in Toms eyes before butnow it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company atthe pump. White mulatto and negro boys and girls were always therewaiting their turns resting trading playthings quarrellingfighting skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was onlya hundred and fifty yards off Jim never got back with a bucket ofwater under an hour and even then somebody generally had to go afterhim. Tom saidSay Jim Ill fetch the water if youll whitewash some.Jim shook his head and saidCant Mars Tom. Ole missis she tole me I got to go an git diswater an not stop foolin roun wid anybody. She say she spec MarsTom gwine to ax me to whitewash an so she tole me go long an tendto my own business she lowed SHED tend to de whitewashin.Oh never you mind what she said Jim. Thats the way she alwaystalks. Gimme the bucket I wont be gone only a a minute. SHE wontever know.Oh I dasnt Mars Tom. Ole missis shed take an tar de head offnme. Deed she would.SHE She never licks anybody whacks em over the head with herthimble and who cares for that Id like to know. She talks awful buttalk dont hurt anyways it dont if she dont cry. Jim Ill give youa marvel. Ill give you a white alleyJim began to waver.White alley Jim And its a bully taw.My Dats a mighty gay marvel I tell you But Mars Tom Is powerfulfraid ole missis And besides if you will Ill show you my sore toe.Jim was only human this attraction was too much for him. He put downhis pail took the white alley and bent over the toe with absorbinginterest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he wasflying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear Tom waswhitewashing with vigor and Aunt Polly was retiring from the fieldwith a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.But Toms energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he hadplanned for this day and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boyswould come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions andthey would make a world of fun of him for having to work the verythought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth andexamined it bits of toys marbles and trash enough to buy anexchange of WORK maybe but not half enough to buy so much as half anhour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to hispocket and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this darkand hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him Nothing less than agreat magnificent inspiration.He took up his brush and went tranquilly to work. Ben Rogers hove insight presently the very boy of all boys whose ridicule he had beendreading. Bens gait was the hopskipandjump proof enough that hisheart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple andgiving a long melodious whoop at intervals followed by a deeptoneddingdongdong dingdongdong for he was personating a steamboat. Ashe drew near he slackened speed took the middle of the street leanedfar over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laboriouspomp and circumstance for he was personating the Big Missouri andconsidered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat andcaptain and enginebells combined so he had to imagine himselfstanding on his own hurricanedeck giving the orders and executing themStop her sir Tingalingling The headway ran almost out and hedrew up slowly toward the sidewalk.Ship up to back Tingalingling His arms straightened andstiffened down his sides.Set her back on the stabboard Tingalingling Chow chchowwowChow His right hand meantime describing stately circles for it wasrepresenting a fortyfoot wheel.Let her go back on the labboard Tingalingling ChowchchowchowThe left hand began to describe circles.Stop the stabboard Tingalingling Stop the labboard Come aheadon the stabboard Stop her Let your outside turn over slowTingalingling Chowowow Get out that headline LIVELY nowCome out with your springline whatre you about there Take a turnround that stump with the bight of it Stand by that stage now let hergo Done with the engines sir Tingalingling SHT SHT SHTtrying the gaugecocks.Tom went on whitewashing paid no attention to the steamboat. Benstared a moment and then said HiYI YOURE up a stump aint youNo answer. Tom surveyed his last touch with the eye of an artist thenhe gave his brush another gentle sweep and surveyed the result asbefore. Ben ranged up alongside of him. Toms mouth watered for theapple but he stuck to his work. Ben saidHello old chap you got to work heyTom wheeled suddenly and saidWhy its you Ben I warnt noticing.Say Im going in aswimming I am. Dont you wish you could But ofcourse youd druther WORK wouldnt you Course you wouldTom contemplated the boy a bit and saidWhat do you call workWhy aint THAT workTom resumed his whitewashing and answered carelesslyWell maybe it is and maybe it aint. All I know is it suits TomSawyer.Oh come now you dont mean to let on that you LIKE itThe brush continued to move.Like it Well I dont see why I oughtnt to like it. Does a boy geta chance to whitewash a fence every dayThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped nibbling his apple. Tomswept his brush daintily back and forth stepped back to note theeffect added a touch here and there criticised the effect again Benwatching every move and getting more and more interested more and moreabsorbed. Presently he saidSay Tom let ME whitewash a little.Tom considered was about to consent but he altered his mindNo no I reckon it wouldnt hardly do Ben. You see Aunt Pollysawful particular about this fence right here on the street you know but if it was the back fence I wouldnt mind and SHE wouldnt. Yesshes awful particular about this fence its got to be done verycareful I reckon there aint one boy in a thousand maybe twothousand that can do it the way its got to be done.No is that so Oh come now lemme just try. Only just a little Idlet YOU if you was me Tom.Ben Id like to honest injun but Aunt Polly well Jim wanted todo it but she wouldnt let him Sid wanted to do it and she wouldntlet Sid. Now dont you see how Im fixed If you was to tackle thisfence and anything was to happen to it Oh shucks Ill be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say Ill giveyou the core of my apple.Well here No Ben now dont. Im afeard Ill give you ALL of itTom gave up the brush with reluctance in his face but alacrity in hisheart. And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated inthe sun the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close bydangled his legs munched his apple and planned the slaughter of moreinnocents. There was no lack of material boys happened along everylittle while they came to jeer but remained to whitewash. By the timeBen was fagged out Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher fora kite in good repair and when he played out Johnny Miller bought infor a dead rat and a string to swing it with and so on and so onhour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came from beinga poor povertystricken boy in the morning Tom was literally rollingin wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned twelve marblespart of a jewsharp a piece of blue bottleglass to look through aspool cannon a key that wouldnt unlock anything a fragment of chalka glass stopper of a decanter a tin soldier a couple of tadpoles sixfirecrackers a kitten with only one eye a brass doorknob adogcollar but no dog the handle of a knife four pieces oforangepeel and a dilapidated old window sash.He had had a nice good idle time all the while plenty of company and the fence had three coats of whitewash on it If he hadnt run outof whitewash he would have bankrupted every boy in the village.Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world after all. Hehad discovered a great law of human action without knowing it namelythat in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing it is onlynecessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a greatand wise philosopher like the writer of this book he would now havecomprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to doand that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. Andthis would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowersor performing on a treadmill is work while rolling tenpins orclimbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen inEngland who drive fourhorse passengercoaches twenty or thirty mileson a daily line in the summer because the privilege costs themconsiderable money but if they were offered wages for the servicethat would turn it into work and then they would resign.The boy mused awhile over the substantial change which had taken placein his worldly circumstances and then wended toward headquarters toreport.CHAPTER IIITOM presented himself before Aunt Polly who was sitting by an openwindow in a pleasant rearward apartment which was bedroombreakfastroom diningroom and library combined. The balmy summerair the restful quiet the odor of the flowers and the drowsing murmurof the bees had had their effect and she was nodding over her knitting for she had no company but the cat and it was asleep in her lap. Herspectacles were propped up on her gray head for safety. She had thoughtthat of course Tom had deserted long ago and she wondered at seeing himplace himself in her power again in this intrepid way. He said MayntI go and play now auntWhat aready How much have you doneIts all done aunt.Tom dont lie to me I cant bear it.I aint aunt it IS all done.Aunt Polly placed small trust in such evidence. She went out to seefor herself and she would have been content to find twenty per cent.of Toms statement true. When she found the entire fence whitewashedand not only whitewashed but elaborately coated and recoated and evena streak added to the ground her astonishment was almost unspeakable.She saidWell I never Theres no getting round it you can work when yourea mind to Tom. And then she diluted the compliment by adding Butits powerful seldom youre a mind to Im bound to say. Well go longand play but mind you get back some time in a week or Ill tan you.She was so overcome by the splendor of his achievement that she tookhim into the closet and selected a choice apple and delivered it tohim along with an improving lecture upon the added value and flavor atreat took to itself when it came without sin through virtuous effort.And while she closed with a happy Scriptural flourish he hooked adoughnut.Then he skipped out and saw Sid just starting up the outside stairwaythat led to the back rooms on the second floor. Clods were handy andthe air was full of them in a twinkling. They raged around Sid like ahailstorm and before Aunt Polly could collect her surprised facultiesand sally to the rescue six or seven clods had taken personal effectand Tom was over the fence and gone. There was a gate but as a generalthing he was too crowded for time to make use of it. His soul was atpeace now that he had settled with Sid for calling attention to hisblack thread and getting him into trouble.Tom skirted the block and came round into a muddy alley that led bythe back of his aunts cowstable. He presently got safely beyond thereach of capture and punishment and hastened toward the public squareof the village where two military companies of boys had met forconflict according to previous appointment. Tom was General of one ofthese armies Joe Harper a bosom friend General of the other. Thesetwo great commanders did not condescend to fight in person that beingbetter suited to the still smaller fry but sat together on an eminenceand conducted the field operations by orders delivered throughaidesdecamp. Toms army won a great victory after a long andhardfought battle. Then the dead were counted prisoners exchangedthe terms of the next disagreement agreed upon and the day for thenecessary battle appointed after which the armies fell into line andmarched away and Tom turned homeward alone.As he was passing by the house where Jeff Thatcher lived he saw a newgirl in the garden a lovely little blueeyed creature with yellow hairplaited into two longtails white summer frock and embroideredpantalettes. The freshcrowned hero fell without firing a shot. Acertain Amy Lawrence vanished out of his heart and left not even amemory of herself behind. He had thought he loved her to distractionhe had regarded his passion as adoration and behold it was only a poorlittle evanescent partiality. He had been months winning her she hadconfessed hardly a week ago he had been the happiest and the proudestboy in the world only seven short days and here in one instant of timeshe had gone out of his heart like a casual stranger whose visit isdone.He worshipped this new angel with furtive eye till he saw that shehad discovered him then he pretended he did not know she was presentand began to show off in all sorts of absurd boyish ways in order towin her admiration. He kept up this grotesque foolishness for sometime but byandby while he was in the midst of some dangerousgymnastic performances he glanced aside and saw that the little girlwas wending her way toward the house. Tom came up to the fence andleaned on it grieving and hoping she would tarry yet awhile longer.She halted a moment on the steps and then moved toward the door. Tomheaved a great sigh as she put her foot on the threshold. But his facelit up right away for she tossed a pansy over the fence a momentbefore she disappeared.The boy ran around and stopped within a foot or two of the flower andthen shaded his eyes with his hand and began to look down street as ifhe had discovered something of interest going on in that direction.Presently he picked up a straw and began trying to balance it on hisnose with his head tilted far back and as he moved from side to sidein his efforts he edged nearer and nearer toward the pansy finallyhis bare foot rested upon it his pliant toes closed upon it and hehopped away with the treasure and disappeared round the corner. Butonly for a minute only while he could button the flower inside hisjacket next his heart or next his stomach possibly for he was notmuch posted in anatomy and not hypercritical anyway.He returned now and hung about the fence till nightfall showingoff as before but the girl never exhibited herself again though Tomcomforted himself a little with the hope that she had been near somewindow meantime and been aware of his attentions. Finally he strodehome reluctantly with his poor head full of visions.All through supper his spirits were so high that his aunt wonderedwhat had got into the child. He took a good scolding about cloddingSid and did not seem to mind it in the least. He tried to steal sugarunder his aunts very nose and got his knuckles rapped for it. He saidAunt you dont whack Sid when he takes it.Well Sid dont torment a body the way you do. Youd be always intothat sugar if I warnt watching you.Presently she stepped into the kitchen and Sid happy in hisimmunity reached for the sugarbowl a sort of glorying over Tom whichwas wellnigh unbearable. But Sids fingers slipped and the bowl droppedand broke. Tom was in ecstasies. In such ecstasies that he evencontrolled his tongue and was silent. He said to himself that he wouldnot speak a word even when his aunt came in but would sit perfectlystill till she asked who did the mischief and then he would tell andthere would be nothing so good in the world as to see that pet modelcatch it. He was so brimful of exultation that he could hardly holdhimself when the old lady came back and stood above the wreckdischarging lightnings of wrath from over her spectacles. He said tohimself Now its coming And the next instant he was sprawling onthe floor The potent palm was uplifted to strike again when Tom criedoutHold on now what er you belting ME for Sid broke itAunt Polly paused perplexed and Tom looked for healing pity. Butwhen she got her tongue again she only saidUmf Well you didnt get a lick amiss I reckon. You been into someother audacious mischief when I wasnt around like enough.Then her conscience reproached her and she yearned to say somethingkind and loving but she judged that this would be construed into aconfession that she had been in the wrong and discipline forbade that.So she kept silence and went about her affairs with a troubled heart.Tom sulked in a corner and exalted his woes. He knew that in her hearthis aunt was on her knees to him and he was morosely gratified by theconsciousness of it. He would hang out no signals he would take noticeof none. He knew that a yearning glance fell upon him now and thenthrough a film of tears but he refused recognition of it. He picturedhimself lying sick unto death and his aunt bending over him beseechingone little forgiving word but he would turn his face to the wall anddie with that word unsaid. Ah how would she feel then And he picturedhimself brought home from the river dead with his curls all wet andhis sore heart at rest. How she would throw herself upon him and howher tears would fall like rain and her lips pray God to give her backher boy and she would never never abuse him any more But he would liethere cold and white and make no sign a poor little sufferer whosegriefs were at an end. He so worked upon his feelings with the pathosof these dreams that he had to keep swallowing he was so like tochoke and his eyes swam in a blur of water which overflowed when hewinked and ran down and trickled from the end of his nose. And such aluxury to him was this petting of his sorrows that he could not bearto have any worldly cheeriness or any grating delight intrude upon itit was too sacred for such contact and so presently when his cousinMary danced in all alive with the joy of seeing home again after anagelong visit of one week to the country he got up and moved inclouds and darkness out at one door as she brought song and sunshine inat the other.He wandered far from the accustomed haunts of boys and soughtdesolate places that were in harmony with his spirit. A log raft in theriver invited him and he seated himself on its outer edge andcontemplated the dreary vastness of the stream wishing the whilethat he could only be drowned all at once and unconsciously withoutundergoing the uncomfortable routine devised by nature. Then he thoughtof his flower. He got it out rumpled and wilted and it mightilyincreased his dismal felicity. He wondered if she would pity him if sheknew Would she cry and wish that she had a right to put her armsaround his neck and comfort him Or would she turn coldly away like allthe hollow world This picture brought such an agony of pleasurablesuffering that he worked it over and over again in his mind and set itup in new and varied lights till he wore it threadbare. At last herose up sighing and departed in the darkness.About halfpast nine or ten oclock he came along the deserted streetto where the Adored Unknown lived he paused a moment no sound fellupon his listening ear a candle was casting a dull glow upon thecurtain of a secondstory window. Was the sacred presence there Heclimbed the fence threaded his stealthy way through the plants tillhe stood under that window he looked up at it long and with emotionthen he laid him down on the ground under it disposing himself uponhis back with his hands clasped upon his breast and holding his poorwilted flower. And thus he would die out in the cold world with noshelter over his homeless head no friendly hand to wipe thedeathdamps from his brow no loving face to bend pityingly over himwhen the great agony came. And thus SHE would see him when she lookedout upon the glad morning and oh would she drop one little tear uponhis poor lifeless form would she heave one little sigh to see a brightyoung life so rudely blighted so untimely cut downThe window went up a maidservants discordant voice profaned theholy calm and a deluge of water drenched the prone martyrs remainsThe strangling hero sprang up with a relieving snort. There was a whizas of a missile in the air mingled with the murmur of a curse a soundas of shivering glass followed and a small vague form went over thefence and shot away in the gloom.Not long after as Tom all undressed for bed was surveying hisdrenched garments by the light of a tallow dip Sid woke up but if hehad any dim idea of making any references to allusions he thoughtbetter of it and held his peace for there was danger in Toms eye.Tom turned in without the added vexation of prayers and Sid mademental note of the omission.CHAPTER IVTHE sun rose upon a tranquil world and beamed down upon the peacefulvillage like a benediction. Breakfast over Aunt Polly had familyworship it began with a prayer built from the ground up of solidcourses of Scriptural quotations welded together with a thin mortar oforiginality and from the summit of this she delivered a grim chapterof the Mosaic Law as from Sinai.Then Tom girded up his loins so to speak and went to work to gethis verses. Sid had learned his lesson days before. Tom bent all hisenergies to the memorizing of five verses and he chose part of theSermon on the Mount because he could find no verses that were shorter.At the end of half an hour Tom had a vague general idea of his lessonbut no more for his mind was traversing the whole field of humanthought and his hands were busy with distracting recreations. Marytook his book to hear him recite and he tried to find his way throughthe fogBlessed are the a a Poor Yes poor blessed are the poor a a In spirit In spirit blessed are the poor in spirit for they they THEIRS For THEIRS. Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdomof heaven. Blessed are they that mourn for they they Sh For they a S H A For they S H Oh I dont know what it isSHALLOh SHALL for they shall for they shall a a shall mourn a a blessed are they that shall they that a they that shall mourn forthey shall a shall WHAT Why dont you tell me Mary what do youwant to be so mean forOh Tom you poor thickheaded thing Im not teasing you. I wouldntdo that. You must go and learn it again. Dont you be discouraged Tomyoull manage it and if you do Ill give you something ever so nice.There now thats a good boy.All right What is it Mary tell me what it is.Never you mind Tom. You know if I say its nice it is nice.You bet you thats so Mary. All right Ill tackle it again.And he did tackle it again and under the double pressure ofcuriosity and prospective gain he did it with such spirit that heaccomplished a shining success. Mary gave him a brandnew Barlowknife worth twelve and a half cents and the convulsion of delight thatswept his system shook him to his foundations. True the knife wouldnot cut anything but it was a sureenough Barlow and there wasinconceivable grandeur in that though where the Western boys ever gotthe idea that such a weapon could possibly be counterfeited to itsinjury is an imposing mystery and will always remain so perhaps. Tomcontrived to scarify the cupboard with it and was arranging to beginon the bureau when he was called off to dress for Sundayschool.Mary gave him a tin basin of water and a piece of soap and he wentoutside the door and set the basin on a little bench there then hedipped the soap in the water and laid it down turned up his sleevespoured out the water on the ground gently and then entered thekitchen and began to wipe his face diligently on the towel behind thedoor. But Mary removed the towel and saidNow aint you ashamed Tom. You mustnt be so bad. Water wont hurtyou.Tom was a trifle disconcerted. The basin was refilled and this timehe stood over it a little while gathering resolution took in a bigbreath and began. When he entered the kitchen presently with both eyesshut and groping for the towel with his hands an honorable testimonyof suds and water was dripping from his face. But when he emerged fromthe towel he was not yet satisfactory for the clean territory stoppedshort at his chin and his jaws like a mask below and beyond this linethere was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward infront and backward around his neck. Mary took him in hand and when shewas done with him he was a man and a brother without distinction ofcolor and his saturated hair was neatly brushed and its short curlswrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect. He privatelysmoothed out the curls with labor and difficulty and plastered hishair close down to his head for he held curls to be effeminate andhis own filled his life with bitterness. Then Mary got out a suit ofhis clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years theywere simply called his other clothes and so by that we know thesize of his wardrobe. The girl put him to rights after he had dressedhimself she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin turned hisvast shirt collar down over his shoulders brushed him off and crownedhim with his speckled straw hat. He now looked exceedingly improved anduncomfortable. He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked for therewas a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him. Hehoped that Mary would forget his shoes but the hope was blighted shecoated them thoroughly with tallow as was the custom and brought themout. He lost his temper and said he was always being made to doeverything he didnt want to do. But Mary said persuasivelyPlease Tom thats a good boy.So he got into the shoes snarling. Mary was soon ready and the threechildren set out for Sundayschool a place that Tom hated with hiswhole heart but Sid and Mary were fond of it.Sabbathschool hours were from nine to halfpast ten and then churchservice. Two of the children always remained for the sermonvoluntarily and the other always remained too for stronger reasons.The churchs highbacked uncushioned pews would seat about threehundred persons the edifice was but a small plain affair with a sortof pine board treebox on top of it for a steeple. At the door Tomdropped back a step and accosted a Sundaydressed comradeSay Billy got a yaller ticketYes.Whatll you take for herWhatll you givePiece of lickrish and a fishhook.Less see em.Tom exhibited. They were satisfactory and the property changed hands.Then Tom traded a couple of white alleys for three red tickets andsome small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones. He waylaid otherboys as they came and went on buying tickets of various colors ten orfifteen minutes longer. He entered the church now with a swarm ofclean and noisy boys and girls proceeded to his seat and started aquarrel with the first boy that came handy. The teacher a graveelderly man interfered then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled aboys hair in the next bench and was absorbed in his book when the boyturned around stuck a pin in another boy presently in order to hearhim say Ouch and got a new reprimand from his teacher. Toms wholeclass were of a pattern restless noisy and troublesome. When theycame to recite their lessons not one of them knew his versesperfectly but had to be prompted all along. However they worriedthrough and each got his reward in small blue tickets each with apassage of Scripture on it each blue ticket was pay for two verses ofthe recitation. Ten blue tickets equalled a red one and could beexchanged for it ten red tickets equalled a yellow one for ten yellowtickets the superintendent gave a very plainly bound Bible worth fortycents in those easy times to the pupil. How many of my readers wouldhave the industry and application to memorize two thousand verses evenfor a Dore Bible And yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way itwas the patient work of two years and a boy of German parentage hadwon four or five. He once recited three thousand verses withoutstopping but the strain upon his mental faculties was too great andhe was little better than an idiot from that day forth a grievousmisfortune for the school for on great occasions before company thesuperintendent as Tom expressed it had always made this boy come outand spread himself. Only the older pupils managed to keep theirtickets and stick to their tedious work long enough to get a Bible andso the delivery of one of these prizes was a rare and noteworthycircumstance the successful pupil was so great and conspicuous forthat day that on the spot every scholars heart was fired with a freshambition that often lasted a couple of weeks. It is possible that Tomsmental stomach had never really hungered for one of those prizes butunquestionably his entire being had for many a day longed for the gloryand the eclat that came with it.In due course the superintendent stood up in front of the pulpit witha closed hymnbook in his hand and his forefinger inserted between itsleaves and commanded attention. When a Sundayschool superintendentmakes his customary little speech a hymnbook in the hand is asnecessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singerwho stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert though why is a mystery for neither the hymnbook nor the sheet ofmusic is ever referred to by the sufferer. This superintendent was aslim creature of thirtyfive with a sandy goatee and short sandy hairhe wore a stiff standingcollar whose upper edge almost reached hisears and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of hismouth a fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead and a turningof the whole body when a side view was required his chin was proppedon a spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a banknoteand had fringed ends his boot toes were turned sharply up in thefashion of the day like sleighrunners an effect patiently andlaboriously produced by the young men by sitting with their toespressed against a wall for hours together. Mr. Walters was very earnestof mien and very sincere and honest at heart and he held sacredthings and places in such reverence and so separated them from worldlymatters that unconsciously to himself his Sundayschool voice hadacquired a peculiar intonation which was wholly absent on weekdays. Hebegan after this fashionNow children I want you all to sit up just as straight and prettyas you can and give me all your attention for a minute or two. There that is it. That is the way good little boys and girls should do. I seeone little girl who is looking out of the window I am afraid shethinks I am out there somewhere perhaps up in one of the trees makinga speech to the little birds. Applausive titter. I want to tell youhow good it makes me feel to see so many bright clean little facesassembled in a place like this learning to do right and be good. Andso forth and so on. It is not necessary to set down the rest of theoration. It was of a pattern which does not vary and so it is familiarto us all.The latter third of the speech was marred by the resumption of fightsand other recreations among certain of the bad boys and by fidgetingsand whisperings that extended far and wide washing even to the basesof isolated and incorruptible rocks like Sid and Mary. But now everysound ceased suddenly with the subsidence of Mr. Walters voice andthe conclusion of the speech was received with a burst of silentgratitude.A good part of the whispering had been occasioned by an event whichwas more or less rare the entrance of visitors lawyer Thatcheraccompanied by a very feeble and aged man a fine portly middleagedgentleman with irongray hair and a dignified lady who was doubtlessthe latters wife. The lady was leading a child. Tom had been restlessand full of chafings and repinings consciencesmitten too he couldnot meet Amy Lawrences eye he could not brook her loving gaze. Butwhen he saw this small newcomer his soul was all ablaze with bliss ina moment. The next moment he was showing off with all his might cuffing boys pulling hair making faces in a word using every artthat seemed likely to fascinate a girl and win her applause. Hisexaltation had but one alloy the memory of his humiliation in thisangels garden and that record in sand was fast washing out underthe waves of happiness that were sweeping over it now.The visitors were given the highest seat of honor and as soon as Mr.Walters speech was finished he introduced them to the school. Themiddleaged man turned out to be a prodigious personage no less a onethan the county judge altogether the most august creation thesechildren had ever looked upon and they wondered what kind of materialhe was made of and they half wanted to hear him roar and were halfafraid he might too. He was from Constantinople twelve miles away sohe had travelled and seen the world these very eyes had looked uponthe county courthouse which was said to have a tin roof. The awewhich these reflections inspired was attested by the impressive silenceand the ranks of staring eyes. This was the great Judge Thatcherbrother of their own lawyer. Jeff Thatcher immediately went forward tobe familiar with the great man and be envied by the school. It wouldhave been music to his soul to hear the whisperingsLook at him Jim Hes a going up there. Say look hes a going toshake hands with him he IS shaking hands with him By jings dont youwish you was JeffMr. Walters fell to showing off with all sorts of officialbustlings and activities giving orders delivering judgmentsdischarging directions here there everywhere that he could find atarget. The librarian showed off running hither and thither with hisarms full of books and making a deal of the splutter and fuss thatinsect authority delights in. The young lady teachers showed off bending sweetly over pupils that were lately being boxed liftingpretty warning fingers at bad little boys and patting good oneslovingly. The young gentlemen teachers showed off with smallscoldings and other little displays of authority and fine attention todiscipline and most of the teachers of both sexes found business upat the library by the pulpit and it was business that frequently hadto be done over again two or three times with much seeming vexation.The little girls showed off in various ways and the little boysshowed off with such diligence that the air was thick with paper wadsand the murmur of scufflings. And above it all the great man sat andbeamed a majestic judicial smile upon all the house and warmed himselfin the sun of his own grandeur for he was showing off too.There was only one thing wanting to make Mr. Walters ecstasycomplete and that was a chance to deliver a Bibleprize and exhibit aprodigy. Several pupils had a few yellow tickets but none had enough he had been around among the star pupils inquiring. He would have givenworlds now to have that German lad back again with a sound mind.And now at this moment when hope was dead Tom Sawyer came forwardwith nine yellow tickets nine red tickets and ten blue ones anddemanded a Bible. This was a thunderbolt out of a clear sky. Walterswas not expecting an application from this source for the next tenyears. But there was no getting around it here were the certifiedchecks and they were good for their face. Tom was therefore elevatedto a place with the Judge and the other elect and the great news wasannounced from headquarters. It was the most stunning surprise of thedecade and so profound was the sensation that it lifted the new heroup to the judicial ones altitude and the school had two marvels togaze upon in place of one. The boys were all eaten up with envy butthose that suffered the bitterest pangs were those who perceived toolate that they themselves had contributed to this hated splendor bytrading tickets to Tom for the wealth he had amassed in sellingwhitewashing privileges. These despised themselves as being the dupesof a wily fraud a guileful snake in the grass.The prize was delivered to Tom with as much effusion as thesuperintendent could pump up under the circumstances but it lackedsomewhat of the true gush for the poor fellows instinct taught himthat there was a mystery here that could not well bear the lightperhaps it was simply preposterous that this boy had warehoused twothousand sheaves of Scriptural wisdom on his premises a dozen wouldstrain his capacity without a doubt.Amy Lawrence was proud and glad and she tried to make Tom see it inher face but he wouldnt look. She wondered then she was just a graintroubled next a dim suspicion came and went came again she watcheda furtive glance told her worlds and then her heart broke and she wasjealous and angry and the tears came and she hated everybody. Tommost of all she thought.Tom was introduced to the Judge but his tongue was tied his breathwould hardly come his heart quaked partly because of the awfulgreatness of the man but mainly because he was her parent. He wouldhave liked to fall down and worship him if it were in the dark. TheJudge put his hand on Toms head and called him a fine little man andasked him what his name was. The boy stammered gasped and got it outTom.Oh no not Tom it is Thomas.Ah thats it. I thought there was more to it maybe. Thats verywell. But youve another one I daresay and youll tell it to me wontyouTell the gentleman your other name Thomas said Walters and saysir. You mustnt forget your manners.Thomas Sawyer sir.Thats it Thats a good boy. Fine boy. Fine manly little fellow.Two thousand verses is a great many very very great many. And younever can be sorry for the trouble you took to learn them forknowledge is worth more than anything there is in the world its whatmakes great men and good men youll be a great man and a good manyourself some day Thomas and then youll look back and say Its allowing to the precious Sundayschool privileges of my boyhood its allowing to my dear teachers that taught me to learn its all owing tothe good superintendent who encouraged me and watched over me andgave me a beautiful Bible a splendid elegant Bible to keep and haveit all for my own always its all owing to right bringing up That iswhat you will say Thomas and you wouldnt take any money for thosetwo thousand verses no indeed you wouldnt. And now you wouldnt mindtelling me and this lady some of the things youve learned no I knowyou wouldnt for we are proud of little boys that learn. Now nodoubt you know the names of all the twelve disciples. Wont you tell usthe names of the first two that were appointedTom was tugging at a buttonhole and looking sheepish. He blushednow and his eyes fell. Mr. Walters heart sank within him. He said tohimself it is not possible that the boy can answer the simplestquestion why DID the Judge ask him Yet he felt obliged to speak upand sayAnswer the gentleman Thomas dont be afraid.Tom still hung fire.Now I know youll tell me said the lady. The names of the firsttwo disciples were DAVID AND GOLIAHLet us draw the curtain of charity over the rest of the scene.CHAPTER VABOUT halfpast ten the cracked bell of the small church began toring and presently the people began to gather for the morning sermon.The Sundayschool children distributed themselves about the house andoccupied pews with their parents so as to be under supervision. AuntPolly came and Tom and Sid and Mary sat with her Tom being placednext the aisle in order that he might be as far away from the openwindow and the seductive outside summer scenes as possible. The crowdfiled up the aisles the aged and needy postmaster who had seen betterdays the mayor and his wife for they had a mayor there among otherunnecessaries the justice of the peace the widow Douglass fairsmart and forty a generous goodhearted soul and welltodo herhill mansion the only palace in the town and the most hospitable andmuch the most lavish in the matter of festivities that St. Petersburgcould boast the bent and venerable Major and Mrs. Ward lawyerRiverson the new notable from a distance next the belle of thevillage followed by a troop of lawnclad and ribbondecked youngheartbreakers then all the young clerks in town in a body for theyhad stood in the vestibule sucking their caneheads a circling wall ofoiled and simpering admirers till the last girl had run their gantletand last of all came the Model Boy Willie Mufferson taking as heedfulcare of his mother as if she were cut glass. He always brought hismother to church and was the pride of all the matrons. The boys allhated him he was so good. And besides he had been thrown up to themso much. His white handkerchief was hanging out of his pocket behind asusual on Sundays accidentally. Tom had no handkerchief and he lookedupon boys who had as snobs.The congregation being fully assembled now the bell rang once moreto warn laggards and stragglers and then a solemn hush fell upon thechurch which was only broken by the tittering and whispering of thechoir in the gallery. The choir always tittered and whispered allthrough service. There was once a church choir that was not illbredbut I have forgotten where it was now. It was a great many years agoand I can scarcely remember anything about it but I think it was insome foreign country.The minister gave out the hymn and read it through with a relish ina peculiar style which was much admired in that part of the country.His voice began on a medium key and climbed steadily up till it reacheda certain point where it bore with strong emphasis upon the topmostword and then plunged down as if from a springboard Shall I be carried toe the skies on flowry BEDS of ease Whilst others fight to win the prize and sail thro BLOODY seasHe was regarded as a wonderful reader. At church sociables he wasalways called upon to read poetry and when he was through the ladieswould lift up their hands and let them fall helplessly in their lapsand wall their eyes and shake their heads as much as to say Wordscannot express it it is too beautiful TOO beautiful for this mortalearth.After the hymn had been sung the Rev. Mr. Sprague turned himself intoa bulletinboard and read off notices of meetings and societies andthings till it seemed that the list would stretch out to the crack ofdoom a queer custom which is still kept up in America even in citiesaway here in this age of abundant newspapers. Often the less there isto justify a traditional custom the harder it is to get rid of it.And now the minister prayed. A good generous prayer it was and wentinto details it pleaded for the church and the little children of thechurch for the other churches of the village for the village itselffor the county for the State for the State officers for the UnitedStates for the churches of the United States for Congress for thePresident for the officers of the Government for poor sailors tossedby stormy seas for the oppressed millions groaning under the heel ofEuropean monarchies and Oriental despotisms for such as have the lightand the good tidings and yet have not eyes to see nor ears to hearwithal for the heathen in the far islands of the sea and closed witha supplication that the words he was about to speak might find graceand favor and be as seed sown in fertile ground yielding in time agrateful harvest of good. Amen.There was a rustling of dresses and the standing congregation satdown. The boy whose history this book relates did not enjoy the prayerhe only endured it if he even did that much. He was restive allthrough it he kept tally of the details of the prayer unconsciously for he was not listening but he knew the ground of old and theclergymans regular route over it and when a little trifle of newmatter was interlarded his ear detected it and his whole natureresented it he considered additions unfair and scoundrelly. In themidst of the prayer a fly had lit on the back of the pew in front ofhim and tortured his spirit by calmly rubbing its hands togetherembracing its head with its arms and polishing it so vigorously thatit seemed to almost part company with the body and the slender threadof a neck was exposed to view scraping its wings with its hind legsand smoothing them to its body as if they had been coattails goingthrough its whole toilet as tranquilly as if it knew it was perfectlysafe. As indeed it was for as sorely as Toms hands itched to grab forit they did not dare he believed his soul would be instantly destroyedif he did such a thing while the prayer was going on. But with theclosing sentence his hand began to curve and steal forward and theinstant the Amen was out the fly was a prisoner of war. His auntdetected the act and made him let it go.The minister gave out his text and droned along monotonously throughan argument that was so prosy that many a head by and by began to nod and yet it was an argument that dealt in limitless fire and brimstoneand thinned the predestined elect down to a company so small as to behardly worth the saving. Tom counted the pages of the sermon afterchurch he always knew how many pages there had been but he seldom knewanything else about the discourse. However this time he was reallyinterested for a little while. The minister made a grand and movingpicture of the assembling together of the worlds hosts at themillennium when the lion and the lamb should lie down together and alittle child should lead them. But the pathos the lesson the moral ofthe great spectacle were lost upon the boy he only thought of theconspicuousness of the principal character before the onlookingnations his face lit with the thought and he said to himself that hewished he could be that child if it was a tame lion.Now he lapsed into suffering again as the dry argument was resumed.Presently he bethought him of a treasure he had and got it out. It wasa large black beetle with formidable jaws a pinchbug he called it.It was in a percussioncap box. The first thing the beetle did was totake him by the finger. A natural fillip followed the beetle wentfloundering into the aisle and lit on its back and the hurt fingerwent into the boys mouth. The beetle lay there working its helplesslegs unable to turn over. Tom eyed it and longed for it but it wassafe out of his reach. Other people uninterested in the sermon foundrelief in the beetle and they eyed it too. Presently a vagrant poodledog came idling along sad at heart lazy with the summer softness andthe quiet weary of captivity sighing for change. He spied the beetlethe drooping tail lifted and wagged. He surveyed the prize walkedaround it smelt at it from a safe distance walked around it againgrew bolder and took a closer smell then lifted his lip and made agingerly snatch at it just missing it made another and anotherbegan to enjoy the diversion subsided to his stomach with the beetlebetween his paws and continued his experiments grew weary at lastand then indifferent and absentminded. His head nodded and little bylittle his chin descended and touched the enemy who seized it. Therewas a sharp yelp a flirt of the poodles head and the beetle fell acouple of yards away and lit on its back once more. The neighboringspectators shook with a gentle inward joy several faces went behindfans and handkerchiefs and Tom was entirely happy. The dog lookedfoolish and probably felt so but there was resentment in his hearttoo and a craving for revenge. So he went to the beetle and began awary attack on it again jumping at it from every point of a circlelighting with his forepaws within an inch of the creature making evencloser snatches at it with his teeth and jerking his head till hisears flapped again. But he grew tired once more after a while triedto amuse himself with a fly but found no relief followed an antaround with his nose close to the floor and quickly wearied of thatyawned sighed forgot the beetle entirely and sat down on it. Thenthere was a wild yelp of agony and the poodle went sailing up theaisle the yelps continued and so did the dog he crossed the house infront of the altar he flew down the other aisle he crossed before thedoors he clamored up the homestretch his anguish grew with hisprogress till presently he was but a woolly comet moving in its orbitwith the gleam and the speed of light. At last the frantic sufferersheered from its course and sprang into its masters lap he flung itout of the window and the voice of distress quickly thinned away anddied in the distance.By this time the whole church was redfaced and suffocating withsuppressed laughter and the sermon had come to a dead standstill. Thediscourse was resumed presently but it went lame and halting allpossibility of impressiveness being at an end for even the gravestsentiments were constantly being received with a smothered burst ofunholy mirth under cover of some remote pewback as if the poorparson had said a rarely facetious thing. It was a genuine relief tothe whole congregation when the ordeal was over and the benedictionpronounced.Tom Sawyer went home quite cheerful thinking to himself that therewas some satisfaction about divine service when there was a bit ofvariety in it. He had but one marring thought he was willing that thedog should play with his pinchbug but he did not think it was uprightin him to carry it off.CHAPTER VIMONDAY morning found Tom Sawyer miserable. Monday morning always foundhim so because it began another weeks slow suffering in school. Hegenerally began that day with wishing he had had no interveningholiday it made the going into captivity and fetters again so muchmore odious.Tom lay thinking. Presently it occurred to him that he wished he wassick then he could stay home from school. Here was a vaguepossibility. He canvassed his system. No ailment was found and heinvestigated again. This time he thought he could detect colickysymptoms and he began to encourage them with considerable hope. Butthey soon grew feeble and presently died wholly away. He reflectedfurther. Suddenly he discovered something. One of his upper front teethwas loose. This was lucky he was about to begin to groan as astarter as he called it when it occurred to him that if he cameinto court with that argument his aunt would pull it out and thatwould hurt. So he thought he would hold the tooth in reserve for thepresent and seek further. Nothing offered for some little time andthen he remembered hearing the doctor tell about a certain thing thatlaid up a patient for two or three weeks and threatened to make himlose a finger. So the boy eagerly drew his sore toe from under thesheet and held it up for inspection. But now he did not know thenecessary symptoms. However it seemed well worth while to chance itso he fell to groaning with considerable spirit.But Sid slept on unconscious.Tom groaned louder and fancied that he began to feel pain in the toe.No result from Sid.Tom was panting with his exertions by this time. He took a rest andthen swelled himself up and fetched a succession of admirable groans.Sid snored on.Tom was aggravated. He said Sid Sid and shook him. This courseworked well and Tom began to groan again. Sid yawned stretched thenbrought himself up on his elbow with a snort and began to stare atTom. Tom went on groaning. Sid saidTom Say Tom No response. Here Tom TOM What is the matterTom And he shook him and looked in his face anxiously.Tom moaned outOh dont Sid. Dont joggle me.Why whats the matter Tom I must call auntie.No never mind. Itll be over by and by maybe. Dont call anybody.But I must DONT groan so Tom its awful. How long you been thiswayHours. Ouch Oh dont stir so Sid youll kill me.Tom why didnt you wake me sooner Oh Tom DONT It makes myflesh crawl to hear you. Tom what is the matterI forgive you everything Sid. Groan. Everything youve ever doneto me. When Im gone Oh Tom you aint dying are you Dont Tom oh dont. Maybe I forgive everybody Sid. Groan. Tell em so Sid. And Sid yougive my windowsash and my cat with one eye to that new girl thatscome to town and tell her But Sid had snatched his clothes and gone. Tom was suffering inreality now so handsomely was his imagination working and so hisgroans had gathered quite a genuine tone.Sid flew downstairs and saidOh Aunt Polly come Toms dyingDyingYesm. Dont wait come quickRubbage I dont believe itBut she fled upstairs nevertheless with Sid and Mary at her heels.And her face grew white too and her lip trembled. When she reachedthe bedside she gasped outYou Tom Tom whats the matter with youOh auntie Im Whats the matter with you what is the matter with you childOh auntie my sore toes mortifiedThe old lady sank down into a chair and laughed a little then cried alittle then did both together. This restored her and she saidTom what a turn you did give me. Now you shut up that nonsense andclimb out of this.The groans ceased and the pain vanished from the toe. The boy felt alittle foolish and he saidAunt Polly it SEEMED mortified and it hurt so I never minded mytooth at all.Your tooth indeed Whats the matter with your toothOne of thems loose and it aches perfectly awful.There there now dont begin that groaning again. Open your mouth.Well your tooth IS loose but youre not going to die about that.Mary get me a silk thread and a chunk of fire out of the kitchen.Tom saidOh please auntie dont pull it out. It dont hurt any more. I wishI may never stir if it does. Please dont auntie. I dont want to stayhome from school.Oh you dont dont you So all this row was because you thoughtyoud get to stay home from school and go afishing Tom Tom I loveyou so and you seem to try every way you can to break my old heartwith your outrageousness. By this time the dental instruments wereready. The old lady made one end of the silk thread fast to Toms toothwith a loop and tied the other to the bedpost. Then she seized thechunk of fire and suddenly thrust it almost into the boys face. Thetooth hung dangling by the bedpost now.But all trials bring their compensations. As Tom wended to schoolafter breakfast he was the envy of every boy he met because the gap inhis upper row of teeth enabled him to expectorate in a new andadmirable way. He gathered quite a following of lads interested in theexhibition and one that had cut his finger and had been a centre offascination and homage up to this time now found himself suddenlywithout an adherent and shorn of his glory. His heart was heavy andhe said with a disdain which he did not feel that it wasnt anything tospit like Tom Sawyer but another boy said Sour grapes and hewandered away a dismantled hero.Shortly Tom came upon the juvenile pariah of the village HuckleberryFinn son of the town drunkard. Huckleberry was cordially hated anddreaded by all the mothers of the town because he was idle and lawlessand vulgar and bad and because all their children admired him so anddelighted in his forbidden society and wished they dared to be likehim. Tom was like the rest of the respectable boys in that he enviedHuckleberry his gaudy outcast condition and was under strict ordersnot to play with him. So he played with him every time he got a chance.Huckleberry was always dressed in the castoff clothes of fullgrownmen and they were in perennial bloom and fluttering with rags. His hatwas a vast ruin with a wide crescent lopped out of its brim his coatwhen he wore one hung nearly to his heels and had the rearward buttonsfar down the back but one suspender supported his trousers the seatof the trousers bagged low and contained nothing the fringed legsdragged in the dirt when not rolled up.Huckleberry came and went at his own free will. He slept on doorstepsin fine weather and in empty hogsheads in wet he did not have to go toschool or to church or call any being master or obey anybody he couldgo fishing or swimming when and where he chose and stay as long as itsuited him nobody forbade him to fight he could sit up as late as hepleased he was always the first boy that went barefoot in the springand the last to resume leather in the fall he never had to wash norput on clean clothes he could swear wonderfully. In a word everythingthat goes to make life precious that boy had. So thought everyharassed hampered respectable boy in St. Petersburg.Tom hailed the romantic outcastHello HuckleberryHello yourself and see how you like it.Whats that you gotDead cat.Lemme see him Huck. My hes pretty stiff. Whered you get himBought him offn a boy.What did you giveI give a blue ticket and a bladder that I got at the slaughterhouse.Whered you get the blue ticketBought it offn Ben Rogers two weeks ago for a hoopstick.Say what is dead cats good for HuckGood for Cure warts with.No Is that so I know something thats better.I bet you dont. What is itWhy spunkwater.Spunkwater I wouldnt give a dern for spunkwater.You wouldnt wouldnt you Dyou ever try itNo I haint. But Bob Tanner did.Who told you soWhy he told Jeff Thatcher and Jeff told Johnny Baker and Johnnytold Jim Hollis and Jim told Ben Rogers and Ben told a nigger andthe nigger told me. There nowWell what of it Theyll all lie. Leastways all but the nigger. Idont know HIM. But I never see a nigger that WOULDNT lie. Shucks Nowyou tell me how Bob Tanner done it Huck.Why he took and dipped his hand in a rotten stump where therainwater was.In the daytimeCertainly.With his face to the stumpYes. Least I reckon so.Did he say anythingI dont reckon he did. I dont know.Aha Talk about trying to cure warts with spunkwater such a blamefool way as that Why that aint agoing to do any good. You got to goall by yourself to the middle of the woods where you know theres aspunkwater stump and just as its midnight you back up against thestump and jam your hand in and say Barleycorn barleycorn injunmeal shorts Spunkwater spunkwater swaller these wartsand then walk away quick eleven steps with your eyes shut and thenturn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody.Because if you speak the charms busted.Well that sounds like a good way but that aint the way Bob Tannerdone.No sir you can bet he didnt becuz hes the wartiest boy in thistown and he wouldnt have a wart on him if hed knowed how to workspunkwater. Ive took off thousands of warts off of my hands that wayHuck. I play with frogs so much that Ive always got considerable manywarts. Sometimes I take em off with a bean.Yes beans good. Ive done that.Have you Whats your wayYou take and split the bean and cut the wart so as to get someblood and then you put the blood on one piece of the bean and take anddig a hole and bury it bout midnight at the crossroads in the dark ofthe moon and then you burn up the rest of the bean. You see that piecethats got the blood on it will keep drawing and drawing trying tofetch the other piece to it and so that helps the blood to draw thewart and pretty soon off she comes.Yes thats it Huck thats it though when youre burying it if yousay Down bean off wart come no more to bother me its better.Thats the way Joe Harper does and hes been nearly to Coonville andmost everywheres. But say how do you cure em with dead catsWhy you take your cat and go and get in the graveyard long aboutmidnight when somebody that was wicked has been buried and when itsmidnight a devil will come or maybe two or three but you cant seeem you can only hear something like the wind or maybe hear em talkand when theyre taking that feller away you heave your cat after emand say Devil follow corpse cat follow devil warts follow cat Imdone with ye Thatll fetch ANY wart.Sounds right. Dyou ever try it HuckNo but old Mother Hopkins told me.Well I reckon its so then. Becuz they say shes a witch.Say Why Tom I KNOW she is. She witched pap. Pap says so his ownself. He come along one day and he see she was awitching him so hetook up a rock and if she hadnt dodged hed a got her. Well thatvery night he rolled offn a shed wher he was a layin drunk and brokehis arm.Why thats awful. How did he know she was awitching himLord pap can tell easy. Pap says when they keep looking at youright stiddy theyre awitching you. Specially if they mumble. Becuzwhen they mumble theyre saying the Lords Prayer backards.Say Hucky when you going to try the catTonight. I reckon theyll come after old Hoss Williams tonight.But they buried him Saturday. Didnt they get him Saturday nightWhy how you talk How could their charms work till midnight andTHEN its Sunday. Devils dont slosh around much of a Sunday I dontreckon.I never thought of that. Thats so. Lemme go with youOf course if you aint afeard.Afeard Taint likely. Will you meowYes and you meow back if you get a chance. Last time you kep meameowing around till old Hays went to throwing rocks at me and saysDern that cat and so I hove a brick through his window but dontyou tell.I wont. I couldnt meow that night becuz auntie was watching mebut Ill meow this time. Say whats thatNothing but a tick.Whered you get himOut in the woods.Whatll you take for himI dont know. I dont want to sell him.All right. Its a mighty small tick anyway.Oh anybody can run a tick down that dont belong to them. Imsatisfied with it. Its a good enough tick for me.Sho theres ticks a plenty. I could have a thousand of em if Iwanted to.Well why dont you Becuz you know mighty well you cant. This is apretty early tick I reckon. Its the first one Ive seen this year.Say Huck Ill give you my tooth for him.Less see it.Tom got out a bit of paper and carefully unrolled it. Huckleberryviewed it wistfully. The temptation was very strong. At last he saidIs it genuwyneTom lifted his lip and showed the vacancy.Well all right said Huckleberry its a trade.Tom enclosed the tick in the percussioncap box that had lately beenthe pinchbugs prison and the boys separated each feeling wealthierthan before.When Tom reached the little isolated frame schoolhouse he strode inbriskly with the manner of one who had come with all honest speed.He hung his hat on a peg and flung himself into his seat withbusinesslike alacrity. The master throned on high in his greatsplintbottom armchair was dozing lulled by the drowsy hum of study.The interruption roused him.Thomas SawyerTom knew that when his name was pronounced in full it meant trouble.SirCome up here. Now sir why are you late again as usualTom was about to take refuge in a lie when he saw two long tails ofyellow hair hanging down a back that he recognized by the electricsympathy of love and by that form was THE ONLY VACANT PLACE on thegirls side of the schoolhouse. He instantly saidI STOPPED TO TALK WITH HUCKLEBERRY FINNThe masters pulse stood still and he stared helplessly. The buzz ofstudy ceased. The pupils wondered if this foolhardy boy had lost hismind. The master saidYou you did whatStopped to talk with Huckleberry Finn.There was no mistaking the words.Thomas Sawyer this is the most astounding confession I have everlistened to. No mere ferule will answer for this offence. Take off yourjacket.The masters arm performed until it was tired and the stock ofswitches notably diminished. Then the order followedNow sir go and sit with the girls And let this be a warning to you.The titter that rippled around the room appeared to abash the boy butin reality that result was caused rather more by his worshipful awe ofhis unknown idol and the dread pleasure that lay in his high goodfortune. He sat down upon the end of the pine bench and the girlhitched herself away from him with a toss of her head. Nudges and winksand whispers traversed the room but Tom sat still with his arms uponthe long low desk before him and seemed to study his book.By and by attention ceased from him and the accustomed school murmurrose upon the dull air once more. Presently the boy began to stealfurtive glances at the girl. She observed it made a mouth at him andgave him the back of her head for the space of a minute. When shecautiously faced around again a peach lay before her. She thrust itaway. Tom gently put it back. She thrust it away again but with lessanimosity. Tom patiently returned it to its place. Then she let itremain. Tom scrawled on his slate Please take it I got more. Thegirl glanced at the words but made no sign. Now the boy began to drawsomething on the slate hiding his work with his left hand. For a timethe girl refused to notice but her human curiosity presently began tomanifest itself by hardly perceptible signs. The boy worked onapparently unconscious. The girl made a sort of noncommittal attempt tosee but the boy did not betray that he was aware of it. At last shegave in and hesitatingly whisperedLet me see it.Tom partly uncovered a dismal caricature of a house with two gableends to it and a corkscrew of smoke issuing from the chimney. Then thegirls interest began to fasten itself upon the work and she forgoteverything else. When it was finished she gazed a moment thenwhisperedIts nice make a man.The artist erected a man in the front yard that resembled a derrick.He could have stepped over the house but the girl was nothypercritical she was satisfied with the monster and whisperedIts a beautiful man now make me coming along.Tom drew an hourglass with a full moon and straw limbs to it andarmed the spreading fingers with a portentous fan. The girl saidIts ever so nice I wish I could draw.Its easy whispered Tom Ill learn you.Oh will you WhenAt noon. Do you go home to dinnerIll stay if you will.Good thats a whack. Whats your nameBecky Thatcher. Whats yours Oh I know. Its Thomas Sawyer.Thats the name they lick me by. Im Tom when Im good. You call meTom will youYes.Now Tom began to scrawl something on the slate hiding the words fromthe girl. But she was not backward this time. She begged to see. TomsaidOh it aint anything.Yes it is.No it aint. You dont want to see.Yes I do indeed I do. Please let me.Youll tell.No I wont deed and deed and double deed wont.You wont tell anybody at all Ever as long as you liveNo I wont ever tell ANYbody. Now let me.Oh YOU dont want to seeNow that you treat me so I WILL see. And she put her small handupon his and a little scuffle ensued Tom pretending to resist inearnest but letting his hand slip by degrees till these words wererevealed I LOVE YOU.Oh you bad thing And she hit his hand a smart rap but reddenedand looked pleased nevertheless.Just at this juncture the boy felt a slow fateful grip closing on hisear and a steady lifting impulse. In that wise he was borne across thehouse and deposited in his own seat under a peppering fire of gigglesfrom the whole school. Then the master stood over him during a fewawful moments and finally moved away to his throne without saying aword. But although Toms ear tingled his heart was jubilant.As the school quieted down Tom made an honest effort to study but theturmoil within him was too great. In turn he took his place in thereading class and made a botch of it then in the geography class andturned lakes into mountains mountains into rivers and rivers intocontinents till chaos was come again then in the spelling class andgot turned down by a succession of mere baby words till he broughtup at the foot and yielded up the pewter medal which he had worn withostentation for months.CHAPTER VIITHE harder Tom tried to fasten his mind on his book the more hisideas wandered. So at last with a sigh and a yawn he gave it up. Itseemed to him that the noon recess would never come. The air wasutterly dead. There was not a breath stirring. It was the sleepiest ofsleepy days. The drowsing murmur of the five and twenty studyingscholars soothed the soul like the spell that is in the murmur of bees.Away off in the flaming sunshine Cardiff Hill lifted its soft greensides through a shimmering veil of heat tinted with the purple ofdistance a few birds floated on lazy wing high in the air no otherliving thing was visible but some cows and they were asleep. Tomsheart ached to be free or else to have something of interest to do topass the dreary time. His hand wandered into his pocket and his facelit up with a glow of gratitude that was prayer though he did not knowit. Then furtively the percussioncap box came out. He released thetick and put him on the long flat desk. The creature probably glowedwith a gratitude that amounted to prayer too at this moment but itwas premature for when he started thankfully to travel off Tom turnedhim aside with a pin and made him take a new direction.Toms bosom friend sat next him suffering just as Tom had been andnow he was deeply and gratefully interested in this entertainment in aninstant. This bosom friend was Joe Harper. The two boys were swornfriends all the week and embattled enemies on Saturdays. Joe took apin out of his lapel and began to assist in exercising the prisoner.The sport grew in interest momently. Soon Tom said that they wereinterfering with each other and neither getting the fullest benefit ofthe tick. So he put Joes slate on the desk and drew a line down themiddle of it from top to bottom.Now said he as long as he is on your side you can stir him up andIll let him alone but if you let him get away and get on my sideyoure to leave him alone as long as I can keep him from crossing over.All right go ahead start him up.The tick escaped from Tom presently and crossed the equator. Joeharassed him awhile and then he got away and crossed back again. Thischange of base occurred often. While one boy was worrying the tick withabsorbing interest the other would look on with interest as strongthe two heads bowed together over the slate and the two souls dead toall things else. At last luck seemed to settle and abide with Joe. Thetick tried this that and the other course and got as excited and asanxious as the boys themselves but time and again just as he wouldhave victory in his very grasp so to speak and Toms fingers would betwitching to begin Joes pin would deftly head him off and keeppossession. At last Tom could stand it no longer. The temptation wastoo strong. So he reached out and lent a hand with his pin. Joe wasangry in a moment. Said heTom you let him alone.I only just want to stir him up a little Joe.No sir it aint fair you just let him alone.Blame it I aint going to stir him much.Let him alone I tell you.I wontYou shall hes on my side of the line.Look here Joe Harper whose is that tickI dont care whose tick he is hes on my side of the line and youshant touch him.Well Ill just bet I will though. Hes my tick and Ill do what Iblame please with him or dieA tremendous whack came down on Toms shoulders and its duplicate onJoes and for the space of two minutes the dust continued to fly fromthe two jackets and the whole school to enjoy it. The boys had been tooabsorbed to notice the hush that had stolen upon the school awhilebefore when the master came tiptoeing down the room and stood overthem. He had contemplated a good part of the performance before hecontributed his bit of variety to it.When school broke up at noon Tom flew to Becky Thatcher andwhispered in her earPut on your bonnet and let on youre going home and when you get tothe corner give the rest of em the slip and turn down through thelane and come back. Ill go the other way and come it over em the sameway.So the one went off with one group of scholars and the other withanother. In a little while the two met at the bottom of the lane andwhen they reached the school they had it all to themselves. Then theysat together with a slate before them and Tom gave Becky the penciland held her hand in his guiding it and so created another surprisinghouse. When the interest in art began to wane the two fell to talking.Tom was swimming in bliss. He saidDo you love ratsNo I hate themWell I do too LIVE ones. But I mean dead ones to swing round yourhead with a string.No I dont care for rats much anyway. What I like is chewinggum.Oh I should say so I wish I had some now.Do you Ive got some. Ill let you chew it awhile but you must giveit back to me.That was agreeable so they chewed it turn about and dangled theirlegs against the bench in excess of contentment.Was you ever at a circus said Tom.Yes and my pas going to take me again some time if Im good.I been to the circus three or four times lots of times. Church aintshucks to a circus. Theres things going on at a circus all the time.Im going to be a clown in a circus when I grow up.Oh are you That will be nice. Theyre so lovely all spotted up.Yes thats so. And they get slathers of money most a dollar a dayBen Rogers says. Say Becky was you ever engagedWhats thatWhy engaged to be married.No.Would you like toI reckon so. I dont know. What is it likeLike Why it aint like anything. You only just tell a boy you wontever have anybody but him ever ever ever and then you kiss and thatsall. Anybody can do it.Kiss What do you kiss forWhy that you know is to well they always do that.EverybodyWhy yes everybody thats in love with each other. Do you rememberwhat I wrote on the slateYe yes.What was itI shant tell you.Shall I tell YOUYe yes but some other time.No now.No not now tomorrow.Oh no NOW. Please Becky Ill whisper it Ill whisper it ever soeasy.Becky hesitating Tom took silence for consent and passed his armabout her waist and whispered the tale ever so softly with his mouthclose to her ear. And then he addedNow you whisper it to me just the same.She resisted for a while and then saidYou turn your face away so you cant see and then I will. But youmustnt ever tell anybody WILL you Tom Now you wont WILL youNo indeed indeed I wont. Now Becky.He turned his face away. She bent timidly around till her breathstirred his curls and whispered I love youThen she sprang away and ran around and around the desks and bencheswith Tom after her and took refuge in a corner at last with herlittle white apron to her face. Tom clasped her about her neck andpleadedNow Becky its all done all over but the kiss. Dont you be afraidof that it aint anything at all. Please Becky. And he tugged at herapron and the hands.By and by she gave up and let her hands drop her face all glowingwith the struggle came up and submitted. Tom kissed the red lips andsaidNow its all done Becky. And always after this you know you aintever to love anybody but me and you aint ever to marry anybody butme ever never and forever. Will youNo Ill never love anybody but you Tom and Ill never marryanybody but you and you aint to ever marry anybody but me either.Certainly. Of course. Thats PART of it. And always coming to schoolor when were going home youre to walk with me when there aintanybody looking and you choose me and I choose you at parties becausethats the way you do when youre engaged.Its so nice. I never heard of it before.Oh its ever so gay Why me and Amy Lawrence The big eyes told Tom his blunder and he stopped confused.Oh Tom Then I aint the first youve ever been engaged toThe child began to cry. Tom saidOh dont cry Becky I dont care for her any more.Yes you do Tom you know you do.Tom tried to put his arm about her neck but she pushed him away andturned her face to the wall and went on crying. Tom tried again withsoothing words in his mouth and was repulsed again. Then his pride wasup and he strode away and went outside. He stood about restless anduneasy for a while glancing at the door every now and then hopingshe would repent and come to find him. But she did not. Then he beganto feel badly and fear that he was in the wrong. It was a hard strugglewith him to make new advances now but he nerved himself to it andentered. She was still standing back there in the corner sobbing withher face to the wall. Toms heart smote him. He went to her and stood amoment not knowing exactly how to proceed. Then he said hesitatinglyBecky I I dont care for anybody but you.No reply but sobs.Becky pleadingly. Becky wont you say somethingMore sobs.Tom got out his chiefest jewel a brass knob from the top of anandiron and passed it around her so that she could see it and saidPlease Becky wont you take itShe struck it to the floor. Then Tom marched out of the house and overthe hills and far away to return to school no more that day. PresentlyBecky began to suspect. She ran to the door he was not in sight sheflew around to the playyard he was not there. Then she calledTom Come back TomShe listened intently but there was no answer. She had no companionsbut silence and loneliness. So she sat down to cry again and upbraidherself and by this time the scholars began to gather again and shehad to hide her griefs and still her broken heart and take up the crossof a long dreary aching afternoon with none among the strangersabout her to exchange sorrows with.CHAPTER VIIITOM dodged hither and thither through lanes until he was well out ofthe track of returning scholars and then fell into a moody jog. Hecrossed a small branch two or three times because of a prevailingjuvenile superstition that to cross water baffled pursuit. Half an hourlater he was disappearing behind the Douglas mansion on the summit ofCardiff Hill and the schoolhouse was hardly distinguishable away offin the valley behind him. He entered a dense wood picked his pathlessway to the centre of it and sat down on a mossy spot under a spreadingoak. There was not even a zephyr stirring the dead noonday heat hadeven stilled the songs of the birds nature lay in a trance that wasbroken by no sound but the occasional faroff hammering of awoodpecker and this seemed to render the pervading silence and senseof loneliness the more profound. The boys soul was steeped inmelancholy his feelings were in happy accord with his surroundings. Hesat long with his elbows on his knees and his chin in his handsmeditating. It seemed to him that life was but a trouble at best andhe more than half envied Jimmy Hodges so lately released it must bevery peaceful he thought to lie and slumber and dream forever andever with the wind whispering through the trees and caressing thegrass and the flowers over the grave and nothing to bother and grieveabout ever any more. If he only had a clean Sundayschool record hecould be willing to go and be done with it all. Now as to this girl.What had he done Nothing. He had meant the best in the world and beentreated like a dog like a very dog. She would be sorry some day maybewhen it was too late. Ah if he could only die TEMPORARILYBut the elastic heart of youth cannot be compressed into oneconstrained shape long at a time. Tom presently began to driftinsensibly back into the concerns of this life again. What if he turnedhis back now and disappeared mysteriously What if he went away everso far away into unknown countries beyond the seas and never cameback any more How would she feel then The idea of being a clownrecurred to him now only to fill him with disgust. For frivolity andjokes and spotted tights were an offense when they intruded themselvesupon a spirit that was exalted into the vague august realm of theromantic. No he would be a soldier and return after long years allwarworn and illustrious. No better still he would join the Indiansand hunt buffaloes and go on the warpath in the mountain ranges and thetrackless great plains of the Far West and away in the future comeback a great chief bristling with feathers hideous with paint andprance into Sundayschool some drowsy summer morning with abloodcurdling warwhoop and sear the eyeballs of all his companionswith unappeasable envy. But no there was something gaudier even thanthis. He would be a pirate That was it NOW his future lay plainbefore him and glowing with unimaginable splendor. How his name wouldfill the world and make people shudder How gloriously he would goplowing the dancing seas in his long low blackhulled racer theSpirit of the Storm with his grisly flag flying at the fore And atthe zenith of his fame how he would suddenly appear at the old villageand stalk into church brown and weatherbeaten in his black velvetdoublet and trunks his great jackboots his crimson sash his beltbristling with horsepistols his crimerusted cutlass at his side hisslouch hat with waving plumes his black flag unfurled with the skulland crossbones on it and hear with swelling ecstasy the whisperingsIts Tom Sawyer the Pirate the Black Avenger of the Spanish MainYes it was settled his career was determined. He would run away fromhome and enter upon it. He would start the very next morning. Thereforehe must now begin to get ready. He would collect his resourcestogether. He went to a rotten log near at hand and began to dig underone end of it with his Barlow knife. He soon struck wood that soundedhollow. He put his hand there and uttered this incantation impressivelyWhat hasnt come here come Whats here stay hereThen he scraped away the dirt and exposed a pine shingle. He took itup and disclosed a shapely little treasurehouse whose bottom and sideswere of shingles. In it lay a marble. Toms astonishment was boundlessHe scratched his head with a perplexed air and saidWell that beats anythingThen he tossed the marble away pettishly and stood cogitating. Thetruth was that a superstition of his had failed here which he andall his comrades had always looked upon as infallible. If you buried amarble with certain necessary incantations and left it alone afortnight and then opened the place with the incantation he had justused you would find that all the marbles you had ever lost hadgathered themselves together there meantime no matter how widely theyhad been separated. But now this thing had actually and unquestionablyfailed. Toms whole structure of faith was shaken to its foundations.He had many a time heard of this thing succeeding but never of itsfailing before. It did not occur to him that he had tried it severaltimes before himself but could never find the hidingplacesafterward. He puzzled over the matter some time and finally decidedthat some witch had interfered and broken the charm. He thought hewould satisfy himself on that point so he searched around till hefound a small sandy spot with a little funnelshaped depression in it.He laid himself down and put his mouth close to this depression andcalled Doodlebug doodlebug tell me what I want to know Doodlebugdoodlebug tell me what I want to knowThe sand began to work and presently a small black bug appeared for asecond and then darted under again in a fright.He dasnt tell So it WAS a witch that done it. I just knowed it.He well knew the futility of trying to contend against witches so hegave up discouraged. But it occurred to him that he might as well havethe marble he had just thrown away and therefore he went and made apatient search for it. But he could not find it. Now he went back tohis treasurehouse and carefully placed himself just as he had beenstanding when he tossed the marble away then he took another marblefrom his pocket and tossed it in the same way sayingBrother go find your brotherHe watched where it stopped and went there and looked. But it musthave fallen short or gone too far so he tried twice more. The lastrepetition was successful. The two marbles lay within a foot of eachother.Just here the blast of a toy tin trumpet came faintly down the greenaisles of the forest. Tom flung off his jacket and trousers turned asuspender into a belt raked away some brush behind the rotten logdisclosing a rude bow and arrow a lath sword and a tin trumpet and ina moment had seized these things and bounded away barelegged withfluttering shirt. He presently halted under a great elm blew ananswering blast and then began to tiptoe and look warily out this wayand that. He said cautiously to an imaginary companyHold my merry men Keep hid till I blow.Now appeared Joe Harper as airily clad and elaborately armed as Tom.Tom calledHold Who comes here into Sherwood Forest without my passGuy of Guisborne wants no mans pass. Who art thou that that Dares to hold such language said Tom prompting for they talkedby the book from memory.Who art thou that dares to hold such languageI indeed I am Robin Hood as thy caitiff carcase soon shall know.Then art thou indeed that famous outlaw Right gladly will I disputewith thee the passes of the merry wood. Have at theeThey took their lath swords dumped their other traps on the groundstruck a fencing attitude foot to foot and began a grave carefulcombat two up and two down. Presently Tom saidNow if youve got the hang go it livelySo they went it lively panting and perspiring with the work. By andby Tom shoutedFall fall Why dont you fallI shant Why dont you fall yourself Youre getting the worst ofit.Why that aint anything. I cant fall that aint the way it is inthe book. The book says Then with one backhanded stroke he slew poorGuy of Guisborne. Youre to turn around and let me hit you in theback.There was no getting around the authorities so Joe turned receivedthe whack and fell.Now said Joe getting up you got to let me kill YOU. Thats fair.Why I cant do that it aint in the book.Well its blamed mean thats all.Well say Joe you can be Friar Tuck or Much the millers son andlam me with a quarterstaff or Ill be the Sheriff of Nottingham andyou be Robin Hood a little while and kill me.This was satisfactory and so these adventures were carried out. ThenTom became Robin Hood again and was allowed by the treacherous nun tobleed his strength away through his neglected wound. And at last Joerepresenting a whole tribe of weeping outlaws dragged him sadly forthgave his bow into his feeble hands and Tom said Where this arrowfalls there bury poor Robin Hood under the greenwood tree. Then heshot the arrow and fell back and would have died but he lit on anettle and sprang up too gaily for a corpse.The boys dressed themselves hid their accoutrements and went offgrieving that there were no outlaws any more and wondering what moderncivilization could claim to have done to compensate for their loss.They said they would rather be outlaws a year in Sherwood Forest thanPresident of the United States forever.CHAPTER IXAT halfpast nine that night Tom and Sid were sent to bed as usual.They said their prayers and Sid was soon asleep. Tom lay awake andwaited in restless impatience. When it seemed to him that it must benearly daylight he heard the clock strike ten This was despair. Hewould have tossed and fidgeted as his nerves demanded but he wasafraid he might wake Sid. So he lay still and stared up into the dark.Everything was dismally still. By and by out of the stillness littlescarcely perceptible noises began to emphasize themselves. The tickingof the clock began to bring itself into notice. Old beams began tocrack mysteriously. The stairs creaked faintly. Evidently spirits wereabroad. A measured muffled snore issued from Aunt Pollys chamber. Andnow the tiresome chirping of a cricket that no human ingenuity couldlocate began. Next the ghastly ticking of a deathwatch in the wall atthe beds head made Tom shudder it meant that somebodys days werenumbered. Then the howl of a faroff dog rose on the night air and wasanswered by a fainter howl from a remoter distance. Tom was in anagony. At last he was satisfied that time had ceased and eternitybegun he began to doze in spite of himself the clock chimed elevenbut he did not hear it. And then there came mingling with hishalfformed dreams a most melancholy caterwauling. The raising of aneighboring window disturbed him. A cry of Scat you devil and thecrash of an empty bottle against the back of his aunts woodshedbrought him wide awake and a single minute later he was dressed andout of the window and creeping along the roof of the ell on allfours. He meowd with caution once or twice as he went then jumpedto the roof of the woodshed and thence to the ground. Huckleberry Finnwas there with his dead cat. The boys moved off and disappeared in thegloom. At the end of half an hour they were wading through the tallgrass of the graveyard.It was a graveyard of the oldfashioned Western kind. It was on ahill about a mile and a half from the village. It had a crazy boardfence around it which leaned inward in places and outward the rest ofthe time but stood upright nowhere. Grass and weeds grew rank over thewhole cemetery. All the old graves were sunken in there was not atombstone on the place roundtopped wormeaten boards staggered overthe graves leaning for support and finding none. Sacred to the memoryof SoandSo had been painted on them once but it could no longerhave been read on the most of them now even if there had been light.A faint wind moaned through the trees and Tom feared it might be thespirits of the dead complaining at being disturbed. The boys talkedlittle and only under their breath for the time and the place and thepervading solemnity and silence oppressed their spirits. They found thesharp new heap they were seeking and ensconced themselves within theprotection of three great elms that grew in a bunch within a few feetof the grave.Then they waited in silence for what seemed a long time. The hootingof a distant owl was all the sound that troubled the dead stillness.Toms reflections grew oppressive. He must force some talk. So he saidin a whisperHucky do you believe the dead people like it for us to be hereHuckleberry whisperedI wisht I knowed. Its awful solemn like AINT itI bet it is.There was a considerable pause while the boys canvassed this matterinwardly. Then Tom whisperedSay Hucky do you reckon Hoss Williams hears us talkingO course he does. Least his sperrit does.Tom after a pauseI wish Id said Mister Williams. But I never meant any harm.Everybody calls him Hoss.A body cant be too particlar how they talk bout theseyer deadpeople Tom.This was a damper and conversation died again.Presently Tom seized his comrades arm and saidShWhat is it Tom And the two clung together with beating hearts.Sh There tis again Didnt you hear itI There Now you hear it.Lord Tom theyre coming Theyre coming sure. Whatll we doI dono. Think theyll see usOh Tom they can see in the dark same as cats. I wisht I hadntcome.Oh dont be afeard. I dont believe theyll bother us. We aintdoing any harm. If we keep perfectly still maybe they wont notice usat all.Ill try to Tom but Lord Im all of a shiver.ListenThe boys bent their heads together and scarcely breathed. A muffledsound of voices floated up from the far end of the graveyard.Look See there whispered Tom. What is itIts devilfire. Oh Tom this is awful.Some vague figures approached through the gloom swinging anoldfashioned tin lantern that freckled the ground with innumerablelittle spangles of light. Presently Huckleberry whispered with ashudderIts the devils sure enough. Three of em Lordy Tom were gonersCan you prayIll try but dont you be afeard. They aint going to hurt us. NowI lay me down to sleep I ShWhat is it HuckTheyre HUMANS One of em is anyway. One of ems old Muff Pottersvoice.No taint so is itI bet I know it. Dont you stir nor budge. He aint sharp enough tonotice us. Drunk the same as usual likely blamed old ripAll right Ill keep still. Now theyre stuck. Cant find it. Herethey come again. Now theyre hot. Cold again. Hot again. Red hotTheyre pinted right this time. Say Huck I know another o themvoices its Injun Joe.Thats so that murderin halfbreed Id druther they was devils adern sight. What kin they be up toThe whisper died wholly out now for the three men had reached thegrave and stood within a few feet of the boys hidingplace.Here it is said the third voice and the owner of it held thelantern up and revealed the face of young Doctor Robinson.Potter and Injun Joe were carrying a handbarrow with a rope and acouple of shovels on it. They cast down their load and began to openthe grave. The doctor put the lantern at the head of the grave and cameand sat down with his back against one of the elm trees. He was soclose the boys could have touched him.Hurry men he said in a low voice the moon might come out at anymoment.They growled a response and went on digging. For some time there wasno noise but the grating sound of the spades discharging their freightof mould and gravel. It was very monotonous. Finally a spade struckupon the coffin with a dull woody accent and within another minute ortwo the men had hoisted it out on the ground. They pried off the lidwith their shovels got out the body and dumped it rudely on theground. The moon drifted from behind the clouds and exposed the pallidface. The barrow was got ready and the corpse placed on it coveredwith a blanket and bound to its place with the rope. Potter took out alarge springknife and cut off the dangling end of the rope and thensaidNow the cussed things ready Sawbones and youll just out withanother five or here she stays.Thats the talk said Injun Joe.Look here what does this mean said the doctor. You required yourpay in advance and Ive paid you.Yes and you done more than that said Injun Joe approaching thedoctor who was now standing. Five years ago you drove me away fromyour fathers kitchen one night when I come to ask for something toeat and you said I warnt there for any good and when I swore Id geteven with you if it took a hundred years your father had me jailed fora vagrant. Did you think Id forget The Injun blood aint in me fornothing. And now Ive GOT you and you got to SETTLE you knowHe was threatening the doctor with his fist in his face by thistime. The doctor struck out suddenly and stretched the ruffian on theground. Potter dropped his knife and exclaimedHere now dont you hit my pard and the next moment he hadgrappled with the doctor and the two were struggling with might andmain trampling the grass and tearing the ground with their heels.Injun Joe sprang to his feet his eyes flaming with passion snatchedup Potters knife and went creeping catlike and stooping round andround about the combatants seeking an opportunity. All at once thedoctor flung himself free seized the heavy headboard of Williamsgrave and felled Potter to the earth with it and in the same instantthe halfbreed saw his chance and drove the knife to the hilt in theyoung mans breast. He reeled and fell partly upon Potter flooding himwith his blood and in the same moment the clouds blotted out thedreadful spectacle and the two frightened boys went speeding away inthe dark.Presently when the moon emerged again Injun Joe was standing overthe two forms contemplating them. The doctor murmured inarticulatelygave a long gasp or two and was still. The halfbreed mutteredTHAT score is settled damn you.Then he robbed the body. After which he put the fatal knife inPotters open right hand and sat down on the dismantled coffin. Three four five minutes passed and then Potter began to stir and moan. Hishand closed upon the knife he raised it glanced at it and let itfall with a shudder. Then he sat up pushing the body from him andgazed at it and then around him confusedly. His eyes met Joes.Lord how is this Joe he said.Its a dirty business said Joe without moving.What did you do it forI I never done itLook here That kind of talk wont wash.Potter trembled and grew white.I thought Id got sober. Id no business to drink tonight. But itsin my head yet worsen when we started here. Im all in a muddlecant recollect anything of it hardly. Tell me Joe HONEST now oldfeller did I do it Joe I never meant to pon my soul and honor Inever meant to Joe. Tell me how it was Joe. Oh its awful and himso young and promising.Why you two was scuffling and he fetched you one with the headboardand you fell flat and then up you come all reeling and staggeringlike and snatched the knife and jammed it into him just as he fetchedyou another awful clip and here youve laid as dead as a wedge tilnow.Oh I didnt know what I was adoing. I wish I may die this minute ifI did. It was all on account of the whiskey and the excitement Ireckon. I never used a weepon in my life before Joe. Ive fought butnever with weepons. Theyll all say that. Joe dont tell Say youwont tell Joe thats a good feller. I always liked you Joe andstood up for you too. Dont you remember You WONT tell WILL youJoe And the poor creature dropped on his knees before the stolidmurderer and clasped his appealing hands.No youve always been fair and square with me Muff Potter and Iwont go back on you. There now thats as fair as a man can say.Oh Joe youre an angel. Ill bless you for this the longest day Ilive. And Potter began to cry.Come now thats enough of that. This aint any time for blubbering.You be off yonder way and Ill go this. Move now and dont leave anytracks behind you.Potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run. Thehalfbreed stood looking after him. He mutteredIf hes as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as hehad the look of being he wont think of the knife till hes gone sofar hell be afraid to come back after it to such a place by himself chickenheartTwo or three minutes later the murdered man the blanketed corpse thelidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but themoons. The stillness was complete again too.CHAPTER XTHE two boys flew on and on toward the village speechless withhorror. They glanced backward over their shoulders from time to timeapprehensively as if they feared they might be followed. Every stumpthat started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made themcatch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that laynear the village the barking of the aroused watchdogs seemed to givewings to their feet.If we can only get to the old tannery before we break downwhispered Tom in short catches between breaths. I cant stand it muchlonger.Huckleberrys hard pantings were his only reply and the boys fixedtheir eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it.They gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burstthrough the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the shelteringshadows beyond. By and by their pulses slowed down and Tom whisperedHuckleberry what do you reckonll come of thisIf Doctor Robinson dies I reckon hangingll come of it.Do you thoughWhy I KNOW it Tom.Tom thought a while then he saidWholl tell WeWhat are you talking about Spose something happened and Injun JoeDIDNT hang Why hed kill us some time or other just as dead sure aswere a laying here.Thats just what I was thinking to myself Huck.If anybody tells let Muff Potter do it if hes fool enough. Hesgenerally drunk enough.Tom said nothing went on thinking. Presently he whisperedHuck Muff Potter dont know it. How can he tellWhats the reason he dont know itBecause hed just got that whack when Injun Joe done it. Dyou reckonhe could see anything Dyou reckon he knowed anythingBy hokey thats so TomAnd besides lookahere maybe that whack done for HIMNo taint likely Tom. He had liquor in him I could see that andbesides he always has. Well when paps full you might take and belthim over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him. He says sohis own self. So its the same with Muff Potter of course. But if aman was dead sober I reckon maybe that whack might fetch him I dono.After another reflective silence Tom saidHucky you sure you can keep mumTom we GOT to keep mum. You know that. That Injun devil wouldntmake any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was tosqueak bout this and they didnt hang him. Now lookahere Tom lesstake and swear to one another thats what we got to do swear to keepmum.Im agreed. Its the best thing. Would you just hold hands and swearthat we Oh no that wouldnt do for this. Thats good enough for littlerubbishy common things specially with gals cuz THEY go back on youanyway and blab if they get in a huff but there orter be writingbout a big thing like this. And blood.Toms whole being applauded this idea. It was deep and dark andawful the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keepingwith it. He picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moonlighttook a little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon onhis work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slowdownstroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting upthe pressure on the upstrokes. See next page. Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer swears they will keep mum about This and They wish They may Drop down dead in Their Tracks if They ever Tell and Rot.Huckleberry was filled with admiration of Toms facility in writingand the sublimity of his language. He at once took a pin from his lapeland was going to prick his flesh but Tom saidHold on Dont do that. A pins brass. It might have verdigrease onit.Whats verdigreaseIts pison. Thats what it is. You just swaller some of it once youll see.So Tom unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boypricked the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood. Intime after many squeezes Tom managed to sign his initials using theball of his little finger for a pen. Then he showed Huckleberry how tomake an H and an F and the oath was complete. They buried the shingleclose to the wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations andthe fetters that bound their tongues were considered to be locked andthe key thrown away.A figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of theruined building now but they did not notice it.Tom whispered Huckleberry does this keep us from EVER telling ALWAYSOf course it does. It dont make any difference WHAT happens we gotto keep mum. Wed drop down dead dont YOU know thatYes I reckon thats so.They continued to whisper for some little time. Presently a dog set upa long lugubrious howl just outside within ten feet of them. The boysclasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright.Which of us does he mean gasped Huckleberry.I dono peep through the crack. QuickNo YOU TomI cant I cant DO it HuckPlease Tom. There tis againOh lordy Im thankful whispered Tom. I know his voice. Its BullHarbison. If Mr. Harbison owned a slave named Bull Tom would have spoken ofhim as Harbisons Bull but a son or a dog of that name was BullHarbison.Oh thats good I tell you Tom I was most scared to death Id abet anything it was a STRAY dog.The dog howled again. The boys hearts sank once more.Oh my that aint no Bull Harbison whispered Huckleberry. DO TomTom quaking with fear yielded and put his eye to the crack. Hiswhisper was hardly audible when he saidOh Huck IT S A STRAY DOGQuick Tom quick Who does he meanHuck he must mean us both were right together.Oh Tom I reckon were goners. I reckon there aint no mistake boutwhere ILL go to. I been so wicked.Dad fetch it This comes of playing hookey and doing everything afellers told NOT to do. I might a been good like Sid if Id a tried but no I wouldnt of course. But if ever I get off this time I layIll just WALLER in Sundayschools And Tom began to snuffle a little.YOU bad and Huckleberry began to snuffle too. Consound it TomSawyer youre just old pie longside o what I am. Oh LORDY lordylordy I wisht I only had half your chance.Tom choked off and whisperedLook Hucky look Hes got his BACK to usHucky looked with joy in his heart.Well he has by jingoes Did he beforeYes he did. But I like a fool never thought. Oh this is bullyyou know. NOW who can he meanThe howling stopped. Tom pricked up his ears.Sh Whats that he whispered.Sounds like like hogs grunting. No its somebody snoring Tom.That IS it Where bouts is it HuckI bleeve its down at tother end. Sounds so anyway. Pap used tosleep there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you hejust lifts things when HE snores. Besides I reckon he aint evercoming back to this town any more.The spirit of adventure rose in the boys souls once more.Hucky do you dast to go if I leadI dont like to much. Tom spose its Injun JoeTom quailed. But presently the temptation rose up strong again and theboys agreed to try with the understanding that they would take totheir heels if the snoring stopped. So they went tiptoeing stealthilydown the one behind the other. When they had got to within five stepsof the snorer Tom stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap.The man moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight.It was Muff Potter. The boys hearts had stood still and their hopestoo when the man moved but their fears passed away now. They tiptoedout through the broken weatherboarding and stopped at a littledistance to exchange a parting word. That long lugubrious howl rose onthe night air again They turned and saw the strange dog standingwithin a few feet of where Potter was lying and FACING Potter withhis nose pointing heavenward.Oh geeminy its HIM exclaimed both boys in a breath.Say Tom they say a stray dog come howling around Johnny Millershouse bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwillcome in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening andthere aint anybody dead there yet.Well I know that. And suppose there aint. Didnt Gracie Miller fallin the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next SaturdayYes but she aint DEAD. And whats more shes getting better too.All right you wait and see. Shes a goner just as dead sure as MuffPotters a goner. Thats what the niggers say and they know all aboutthese kind of things Huck.Then they separated cogitating. When Tom crept in at his bedroomwindow the night was almost spent. He undressed with excessive cautionand fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of hisescapade. He was not aware that the gentlysnoring Sid was awake andhad been so for an hour.When Tom awoke Sid was dressed and gone. There was a late look in thelight a late sense in the atmosphere. He was startled. Why had he notbeen called persecuted till he was up as usual The thought filledhim with bodings. Within five minutes he was dressed and downstairsfeeling sore and drowsy. The family were still at table but they hadfinished breakfast. There was no voice of rebuke but there wereaverted eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck achill to the culprits heart. He sat down and tried to seem gay but itwas uphill work it roused no smile no response and he lapsed intosilence and let his heart sink down to the depths.After breakfast his aunt took him aside and Tom almost brightened inthe hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so. His auntwept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart soand finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her grayhairs with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try anymore. This was worse than a thousand whippings and Toms heart wassorer now than his body. He cried he pleaded for forgiveness promisedto reform over and over again and then received his dismissal feelingthat he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but afeeble confidence.He left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward Sidand so the latters prompt retreat through the back gate wasunnecessary. He moped to school gloomy and sad and took his floggingalong with Joe Harper for playing hookey the day before with the airof one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead totrifles. Then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on hisdesk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stonystare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go.His elbow was pressing against some hard substance. After a long timehe slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object witha sigh. It was in a paper. He unrolled it. A long lingering colossalsigh followed and his heart broke. It was his brass andiron knobThis final feather broke the camels back.CHAPTER XICLOSE upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrifiedwith the ghastly news. No need of the as yet undreamedof telegraphthe tale flew from man to man from group to group from house tohouse with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course theschoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon the town would havethought strangely of him if he had not.A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had beenrecognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter so the story ran.And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washinghimself in the branch about one or two oclock in the morning andthat Potter had at once sneaked off suspicious circumstancesespecially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was alsosaid that the town had been ransacked for this murderer the publicare not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at averdict but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed downall the roads in every direction and the Sheriff was confident thathe would be captured before night.All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Toms heartbreakvanished and he joined the procession not because he would not athousand times rather go anywhere else but because an awfulunaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful placehe wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismalspectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebodypinched his arm. He turned and his eyes met Huckleberrys. Then bothlooked elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anythingin their mutual glance. But everybody was talking and intent upon thegrisly spectacle before them.Poor fellow Poor young fellow This ought to be a lesson tograve robbers Muff Potterll hang for this if they catch him Thiswas the drift of remark and the minister said It was a judgment Hishand is here.Now Tom shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolidface of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggleand voices shouted Its him its him hes coming himselfWho Who from twenty voices.Muff PotterHallo hes stopped Look out hes turning Dont let him get awayPeople in the branches of the trees over Toms head said he wasnttrying to get away he only looked doubtful and perplexed.Infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take aquiet look at his work I reckon didnt expect any company.The crowd fell apart now and the Sheriff came throughostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellows face washaggard and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stoodbefore the murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his facein his hands and burst into tears.I didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor I neverdone it.Whos accused you shouted a voice.This shot seemed to carry home. Potter lifted his face and lookedaround him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes. He saw Injun Joeand exclaimedOh Injun Joe you promised me youd never Is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the Sheriff.Potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him tothe ground. Then he saidSomething told me t if I didnt come back and get He shudderedthen waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said Tellem Joe tell em it aint any use any more.Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring and heard thestonyhearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting everymoment that the clear sky would deliver Gods lightnings upon his headand wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he hadfinished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse tobreak their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoners life faded andvanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan andit would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.Why didnt you leave What did you want to come here for somebodysaid.I couldnt help it I couldnt help it Potter moaned. I wanted torun away but I couldnt seem to come anywhere but here. And he fellto sobbing again.Injun Joe repeated his statement just as calmly a few minutesafterward on the inquest under oath and the boys seeing that thelightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that Joehad sold himself to the devil. He was now become to them the mostbalefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they couldnot take their fascinated eyes from his face.They inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity shouldoffer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master.Injun Joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in awagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering crowdthat the wound bled a little The boys thought that this happycircumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they weredisappointed for more than one villager remarkedIt was within three feet of Muff Potter when it done it.Toms fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for asmuch as a week after this and at breakfast one morning Sid saidTom you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep meawake half the time.Tom blanched and dropped his eyes.Its a bad sign said Aunt Polly gravely. What you got on yourmind TomNothing. Nothing t I know of. But the boys hand shook so that hespilled his coffee.And you do talk such stuff Sid said. Last night you said Itsblood its blood thats what it is You said that over and over. Andyou said Dont torment me so Ill tell Tell WHAT What is ityoull tellEverything was swimming before Tom. There is no telling what mighthave happened now but luckily the concern passed out of Aunt Pollysface and she came to Toms relief without knowing it. She saidSho Its that dreadful murder. I dream about it most every nightmyself. Sometimes I dream its me that done it.Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemedsatisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly couldand after that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up hisjaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching andfrequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbowlistening a good while at a time and afterward slipped the bandageback to its place again. Toms distress of mind wore off gradually andthe toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed tomake anything out of Toms disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself.It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holdinginquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to hismind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiriesthough it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterpriseshe noticed too that Tom never acted as a witness and that wasstrange and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed amarked aversion to these inquests and always avoided them when hecould. Sid marvelled but said nothing. However even inquests went outof vogue at last and ceased to torture Toms conscience.Every day or two during this time of sorrow Tom watched hisopportunity and went to the little grated jailwindow and smuggled suchsmall comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of. Thejail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edgeof the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it wasseldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tomsconscience.The villagers had a strong desire to tarandfeather Injun Joe andride him on a rail for bodysnatching but so formidable was hischaracter that nobody could be found who was willing to take the leadin the matter so it was dropped. He had been careful to begin both ofhis inqueststatements with the fight without confessing thegraverobbery that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest notto try the case in the courts at present.CHAPTER XIIONE of the reasons why Toms mind had drifted away from its secrettroubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interestitself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom hadstruggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down thewind but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her fathershouse nights and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if sheshould die There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took aninterest in war nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone therewas nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away and his batthere was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began totry all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who areinfatuated with patent medicines and all newfangled methods ofproducing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter inthese things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in afever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailingbut on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all theHealth periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorancethey were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the rot theycontained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get upand what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take andwhat frame of mind to keep ones self in and what sort of clothing towear was all gospel to her and she never observed that herhealthjournals of the current month customarily upset everything theyhad recommended the month before. She was as simplehearted and honestas the day was long and so she was an easy victim. She gatheredtogether her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armedwith death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking withhell following after. But she never suspected that she was not anangel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise to the sufferingneighbors.The water treatment was new now and Toms low condition was awindfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning stood himup in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water thenshe scrubbed him down with a towel like a file and so brought him tothen she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blanketstill she sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it camethrough his pores as Tom said.Yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholyand pale and dejected. She added hot baths sitz baths shower bathsand plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began toassist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blisterplasters. Shecalculated his capacity as she would a jugs and filled him up everyday with quack curealls.Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phasefilled the old ladys heart with consternation. This indifference mustbe broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Painkiller for the firsttime. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled withgratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the watertreatment and everything else and pinned her faith to Painkiller. Shegave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for theresult. Her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace againfor the indifference was broken up. The boy could not have shown awilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him.Tom felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might beromantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to havetoo little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So hethought over various plans for relief and finally hit pon that ofprofessing to be fond of Painkiller. He asked for it so often that hebecame a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himselfand quit bothering her. If it had been Sid she would have had nomisgivings to alloy her delight but since it was Tom she watched thebottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminishbut it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of acrack in the sittingroom floor with it.One day Tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunts yellowcat came along purring eying the teaspoon avariciously and beggingfor a taste. Tom saidDont ask for it unless you want it Peter.But Peter signified that he did want it.You better make sure.Peter was sure.Now youve asked for it and Ill give it to you because there aintanything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustntblame anybody but your own self.Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down thePainkiller. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and thendelivered a warwhoop and set off round and round the room bangingagainst furniture upsetting flowerpots and making general havoc.Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy ofenjoyment with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiminghis unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house againspreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in timeto see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mightyhurrah and sail through the open window carrying the rest of theflowerpots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishmentpeering over her glasses Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.Tom what on earth ails that catI dont know aunt gasped the boy.Why I never see anything like it. What did make him act soDeed I dont know Aunt Polly cats always act so when theyre havinga good time.They do do they There was something in the tone that made Tomapprehensive.Yesm. That is I believe they do.You DOYesm.The old lady was bending down Tom watching with interest emphasizedby anxiety. Too late he divined her drift. The handle of the telltaleteaspoon was visible under the bedvalance. Aunt Polly took it held itup. Tom winced and dropped his eyes. Aunt Polly raised him by theusual handle his ear and cracked his head soundly with her thimble.Now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so forI done it out of pity for him because he hadnt any aunt.Hadnt any aunt you numskull. What has that got to do with itHeaps. Because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself Shed aroasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was ahumanAunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thingin a new light what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boytoo. She began to soften she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a littleand she put her hand on Toms head and said gentlyI was meaning for the best Tom. And Tom it DID do you good.Tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peepingthrough his gravity.I know you was meaning for the best aunty and so was I with Peter.It done HIM good too. I never see him get around so since Oh go long with you Tom before you aggravate me again. And youtry and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt takeany more medicine.Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strangething had been occurring every day latterly. And now as usual of latehe hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with hiscomrades. He was sick he said and he looked it. He tried to seem tobe looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road.Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight and Toms face lighted he gazeda moment and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived Tomaccosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark aboutBecky but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched andwatched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating theowner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocksceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he enteredthe empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frockpassed in at the gate and Toms heart gave a great bound. The nextinstant he was out and going on like an Indian yelling laughingchasing boys jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwinghandsprings standing on his head doing all the heroic things he couldconceive of and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see ifBecky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of itall she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware thathe was there He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity camewarwhooping around snatched a boys cap hurled it to the roof of theschoolhouse broke through a group of boys tumbling them in everydirection and fell sprawling himself under Beckys nose almostupsetting her and she turned with her nose in the air and he heardher say Mf some people think theyre mighty smart always showingoffToms cheeks burned. He gathered himself up and sneaked off crushedand crestfallen.CHAPTER XIIITOMS mind was made up now. He was gloomy and desperate. He was aforsaken friendless boy he said nobody loved him when they foundout what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he hadtried to do right and get along but they would not let him sincenothing would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let themblame HIM for the consequences why shouldnt they What right had thefriendless to complain Yes they had forced him to it at last hewould lead a life of crime. There was no choice.By this time he was far down Meadow Lane and the bell for school totake up tinkled faintly upon his ear. He sobbed now to think heshould never never hear that old familiar sound any more it was veryhard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the coldworld he must submit but he forgave them. Then the sobs came thickand fast.Just at this point he met his souls sworn comrade Joe Harper hardeyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his heart.Plainly here were two souls with but a single thought. Tom wipinghis eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about aresolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home byroaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended byhoping that Joe would not forget him.But it transpired that this was a request which Joe had just beengoing to make of Tom and had come to hunt him up for that purpose. Hismother had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had nevertasted and knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of himand wished him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for himto do but succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret havingdriven her poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die.As the two boys walked sorrowing along they made a new compact tostand by each other and be brothers and never separate till deathrelieved them of their troubles. Then they began to lay their plans.Joe was for being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave anddying some time of cold and want and grief but after listening toTom he conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about alife of crime and so he consented to be a pirate.Three miles below St. Petersburg at a point where the MississippiRiver was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow woodedisland with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well asa rendezvous. It was not inhabited it lay far over toward the furthershore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest. So JacksonsIsland was chosen. Who were to be the subjects of their piracies was amatter that did not occur to them. Then they hunted up HuckleberryFinn and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him hewas indifferent. They presently separated to meet at a lonely spot onthe riverbank two miles above the village at the favorite hour whichwas midnight. There was a small log raft there which they meant tocapture. Each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as hecould steal in the most dark and mysterious way as became outlaws. Andbefore the afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweetglory of spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hearsomething. All who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum andwait.About midnight Tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few triflesand stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking themeetingplace. It was starlight and very still. The mighty river laylike an ocean at rest. Tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed thequiet. Then he gave a low distinct whistle. It was answered from underthe bluff. Tom whistled twice more these signals were answered in thesame way. Then a guarded voice saidWho goes thereTom Sawyer the Black Avenger of the Spanish Main. Name your names.Huck Finn the RedHanded and Joe Harper the Terror of the Seas. Tomhad furnished these titles from his favorite literature.Tis well. Give the countersign.Two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously tothe brooding nightBLOODThen Tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after ittearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort. There wasan easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but itlacked the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate.The Terror of the Seas had brought a side of bacon and had about wornhimself out with getting it there. Finn the RedHanded had stolen askillet and a quantity of halfcured leaf tobacco and had also broughta few corncobs to make pipes with. But none of the pirates smoked orchewed but himself. The Black Avenger of the Spanish Main said itwould never do to start without some fire. That was a wise thoughtmatches were hardly known there in that day. They saw a firesmouldering upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they wentstealthily thither and helped themselves to a chunk. They made animposing adventure of it saying Hist every now and then andsuddenly halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginarydaggerhilts and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foestirred to let him have it to the hilt because dead men tell notales. They knew well enough that the raftsmen were all down at thevillage laying in stores or having a spree but still that was noexcuse for their conducting this thing in an unpiratical way.They shoved off presently Tom in command Huck at the after oar andJoe at the forward. Tom stood amidships gloomybrowed and with foldedarms and gave his orders in a low stern whisperLuff and bring her to the windAyeaye sirSteady steadyyyySteady it is sirLet her go off a pointPoint it is sirAs the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward midstreamit was no doubt understood that these orders were given only forstyle and were not intended to mean anything in particular.What sails she carryingCourses topsls and flyingjib sir.Send the ryals up Lay out aloft there half a dozen of ye foretopmaststunsl Lively nowAyeaye sirShake out that maintogalansl Sheets and braces NOW my heartiesAyeaye sirHellumalee hard a port Stand by to meet her when she comes Portport NOW men With a will SteadyyySteady it is sirThe raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boys pointed herhead right and then lay on their oars. The river was not high sothere was not more than a two or three mile current. Hardly a word wassaid during the next threequarters of an hour. Now the raft waspassing before the distant town. Two or three glimmering lights showedwhere it lay peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep ofstargemmed water unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening.The Black Avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last uponthe scene of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishingshe could see him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and deathwith dauntless heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips.It was but a small strain on his imagination to remove Jacksons Islandbeyond eyeshot of the village and so he looked his last with abroken and satisfied heart. The other pirates were looking their lasttoo and they all looked so long that they came near letting thecurrent drift them out of the range of the island. But they discoveredthe danger in time and made shift to avert it. About two oclock inthe morning the raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above thehead of the island and they waded back and forth until they had landedtheir freight. Part of the little rafts belongings consisted of an oldsail and this they spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent toshelter their provisions but they themselves would sleep in the openair in good weather as became outlaws.They built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirtysteps within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked somebacon in the fryingpan for supper and used up half of the corn ponestock they had brought. It seemed glorious sport to be feasting in thatwild free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabitedisland far from the haunts of men and they said they never wouldreturn to civilization. The climbing fire lit up their faces and threwits ruddy glare upon the pillared treetrunks of their forest templeand upon the varnished foliage and festooning vines.When the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance ofcorn pone devoured the boys stretched themselves out on the grassfilled with contentment. They could have found a cooler place but theywould not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roastingcampfire.AINT it gay said Joe.Its NUTS said Tom. What would the boys say if they could see usSay Well theyd just die to be here hey HuckyI reckon so said Huckleberry anyways Im suited. I dont wantnothing bettern this. I dont ever get enough to eat genally andhere they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so.Its just the life for me said Tom. You dont have to get upmornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all thatblame foolishness. You see a pirate dont have to do ANYTHING Joewhen hes ashore but a hermit HE has to be praying considerable andthen he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way.Oh yes thats so said Joe but I hadnt thought much about ityou know. Id a good deal rather be a pirate now that Ive tried it.You see said Tom people dont go much on hermits nowadays likethey used to in old times but a pirates always respected. And ahermits got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and putsackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and What does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for inquired Huck.I dono. But theyve GOT to do it. Hermits always do. Youd have to dothat if you was a hermit.Dernd if I would said Huck.Well what would you doI dono. But I wouldnt do that.Why Huck youd HAVE to. Howd you get around itWhy I just wouldnt stand it. Id run away.Run away Well you WOULD be a nice old slouch of a hermit. Youd bea disgrace.The RedHanded made no response being better employed. He hadfinished gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loadedit with tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing acloud of fragrant smoke he was in the full bloom of luxuriouscontentment. The other pirates envied him this majestic vice andsecretly resolved to acquire it shortly. Presently Huck saidWhat does pirates have to doTom saidOh they have just a bully time take ships and burn them and getthe money and bury it in awful places in their island where theresghosts and things to watch it and kill everybody in the ships makeem walk a plank.And they carry the women to the island said Joe they dont killthe women.No assented Tom they dont kill the women theyre too noble. Andthe womens always beautiful too.And dont they wear the bulliest clothes Oh no All gold and silverand dimonds said Joe with enthusiasm.Who said Huck.Why the pirates.Huck scanned his own clothing forlornly.I reckon I aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with aregretful pathos in his voice but I aint got none but these.But the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enoughafter they should have begun their adventures. They made him understandthat his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary forwealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe.Gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon theeyelids of the little waifs. The pipe dropped from the fingers of theRedHanded and he slept the sleep of the consciencefree and theweary. The Terror of the Seas and the Black Avenger of the Spanish Mainhad more difficulty in getting to sleep. They said their prayersinwardly and lying down since there was nobody there with authorityto make them kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not tosay them at all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths asthat lest they might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt fromheaven. Then at once they reached and hovered upon the imminent vergeof sleep but an intruder came now that would not down. It wasconscience. They began to feel a vague fear that they had been doingwrong to run away and next they thought of the stolen meat and thenthe real torture came. They tried to argue it away by remindingconscience that they had purloined sweetmeats and apples scores oftimes but conscience was not to be appeased by such thinplausibilities it seemed to them in the end that there was nogetting around the stubborn fact that taking sweetmeats was onlyhooking while taking bacon and hams and such valuables was plainsimple stealing and there was a command against that in the Bible. Sothey inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in the businesstheir piracies should not again be sullied with the crime of stealing.Then conscience granted a truce and these curiously inconsistentpirates fell peacefully to sleep.CHAPTER XIVWHEN Tom awoke in the morning he wondered where he was. He sat up andrubbed his eyes and looked around. Then he comprehended. It was thecool gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace inthe deep pervading calm and silence of the woods. Not a leaf stirrednot a sound obtruded upon great Natures meditation. Beaded dewdropsstood upon the leaves and grasses. A white layer of ashes covered thefire and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air. Joeand Huck still slept.Now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presentlythe hammering of a woodpecker was heard. Gradually the cool dim gray ofthe morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and lifemanifested itself. The marvel of Nature shaking off sleep and going towork unfolded itself to the musing boy. A little green worm camecrawling over a dewy leaf lifting twothirds of his body into the airfrom time to time and sniffing around then proceeding again for hewas measuring Tom said and when the worm approached him of its ownaccord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and fallingby turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined togo elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with itscurved body in the air and then came decisively down upon Toms leg andbegan a journey over him his whole heart was glad for that meant thathe was going to have a new suit of clothes without the shadow of adoubt a gaudy piratical uniform. Now a procession of ants appearedfrom nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggledmanfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its armsand lugged it straight up a treetrunk. A brown spotted ladybugclimbed the dizzy height of a grass blade and Tom bent down close toit and said Ladybug ladybug fly away home your house is on fireyour childrens alone and she took wing and went off to see about it which did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect wascredulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon itssimplicity more than once. A tumblebug came next heaving sturdily atits ball and Tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs againstits body and pretend to be dead. The birds were fairly rioting by thistime. A catbird the Northern mocker lit in a tree over Toms headand trilled out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture ofenjoyment then a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame andstopped on a twig almost within the boys reach cocked his head to oneside and eyed the strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirreland a big fellow of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up atintervals to inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things hadprobably never seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether tobe afraid or not. All Nature was wide awake and stirring now longlances of sunlight pierced down through the dense foliage far and nearand a few butterflies came fluttering upon the scene.Tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with ashout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after andtumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the whitesandbar. They felt no longing for the little village sleeping in thedistance beyond the majestic waste of water. A vagrant current or aslight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this onlygratified them since its going was something like burning the bridgebetween them and civilization.They came back to camp wonderfully refreshed gladhearted andravenous and they soon had the campfire blazing up again. Huck founda spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broadoak or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such awildwood charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee.While Joe was slicing bacon for breakfast Tom and Huck asked him tohold on a minute they stepped to a promising nook in the riverbankand threw in their lines almost immediately they had reward. Joe hadnot had time to get impatient before they were back again with somehandsome bass a couple of sunperch and a small catfish provisionsenough for quite a family. They fried the fish with the bacon and wereastonished for no fish had ever seemed so delicious before. They didnot know that the quicker a freshwater fish is on the fire after he iscaught the better he is and they reflected little upon what a sauceopenair sleeping openair exercise bathing and a large ingredientof hunger make too.They lay around in the shade after breakfast while Huck had a smokeand then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition. Theytramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrushamong solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to theground with a drooping regalia of grapevines. Now and then they cameupon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers.They found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to beastonished at. They discovered that the island was about three mileslong and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest towas only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yardswide. They took a swim about every hour so it was close upon themiddle of the afternoon when they got back to camp. They were toohungry to stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham andthen threw themselves down in the shade to talk. But the talk soonbegan to drag and then died. The stillness the solemnity that broodedin the woods and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon thespirits of the boys. They fell to thinking. A sort of undefined longingcrept upon them. This took dim shape presently it was buddinghomesickness. Even Finn the RedHanded was dreaming of his doorstepsand empty hogsheads. But they were all ashamed of their weakness andnone was brave enough to speak his thought.For some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiarsound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of aclock which he takes no distinct note of. But now this mysterious soundbecame more pronounced and forced a recognition. The boys startedglanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude.There was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullenboom came floating down out of the distance.What is it exclaimed Joe under his breath.I wonder said Tom in a whisper.Taint thunder said Huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder Hark said Tom. Listen dont talk.They waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boomtroubled the solemn hush.Lets go and see.They sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town.They parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water. Thelittle steam ferryboat was about a mile below the village driftingwith the current. Her broad deck seemed crowded with people. There werea great many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in theneighborhood of the ferryboat but the boys could not determine whatthe men in them were doing. Presently a great jet of white smoke burstfrom the ferryboats side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloudthat same dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again.I know now exclaimed Tom somebodys drowndedThats it said Huck they done that last summer when Bill Turnergot drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes himcome up to the top. Yes and they take loaves of bread and putquicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever theres anybodythats drownded theyll float right there and stop.Yes Ive heard about that said Joe. I wonder what makes the breaddo that.Oh it aint the bread so much said Tom I reckon its mostlywhat they SAY over it before they start it out.But they dont say anything over it said Huck. Ive seen em andthey dont.Well thats funny said Tom. But maybe they say it to themselves.Of COURSE they do. Anybody might know that.The other boys agreed that there was reason in what Tom said becausean ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not beexpected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of suchgravity.By jings I wish I was over there now said Joe.I do too said Huck Id give heaps to know who it is.The boys still listened and watched. Presently a revealing thoughtflashed through Toms mind and he exclaimedBoys I know whos drownded its usThey felt like heroes in an instant. Here was a gorgeous triumph theywere missed they were mourned hearts were breaking on their accounttears were being shed accusing memories of unkindness to these poorlost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were beingindulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the wholetown and the envy of all the boys as far as this dazzling notorietywas concerned. This was fine. It was worth while to be a pirate afterall.As twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomedbusiness and the skiffs disappeared. The pirates returned to camp. Theywere jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrioustrouble they were making. They caught fish cooked supper and ate itand then fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and sayingabout them and the pictures they drew of the public distress on theiraccount were gratifying to look upon from their point of view. Butwhen the shadows of night closed them in they gradually ceased totalk and sat gazing into the fire with their minds evidentlywandering elsewhere. The excitement was gone now and Tom and Joecould not keep back thoughts of certain persons at home who were notenjoying this fine frolic as much as they were. Misgivings came theygrew troubled and unhappy a sigh or two escaped unawares. By and byJoe timidly ventured upon a roundabout feeler as to how the othersmight look upon a return to civilization not right now but Tom withered him with derision Huck being uncommitted as yet joinedin with Tom and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to getout of the scrape with as little taint of chickenhearted homesicknessclinging to his garments as he could. Mutiny was effectually laid torest for the moment.As the night deepened Huck began to nod and presently to snore. Joefollowed next. Tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some timewatching the two intently. At last he got up cautiously on his kneesand went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flungby the campfire. He picked up and inspected several largesemicylinders of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chosetwo which seemed to suit him. Then he knelt by the fire and painfullywrote something upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled upand put in his jacket pocket and the other he put in Joes hat andremoved it to a little distance from the owner. And he also put into thehat certain schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value among thema lump of chalk an Indiarubber ball three fishhooks and one of thatkind of marbles known as a sure nough crystal. Then he tiptoed hisway cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearingand straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar.CHAPTER XVA FEW minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar wadingtoward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he washalfway over the current would permit no more wading now so hestruck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swamquartering upstream but still was swept downward rather faster than hehad expected. However he reached the shore finally and drifted alongtill he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on hisjacket pocket found his piece of bark safe and then struck throughthe woods following the shore with streaming garments. Shortly beforeten oclock he came out into an open place opposite the village andsaw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank.Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bankwatching with all his eyes slipped into the water swam three or fourstrokes and climbed into the skiff that did yawl duty at the boatsstern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited panting.Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to castoff. A minute or two later the skiffs head was standing high upagainst the boats swell and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy inhis success for he knew it was the boats last trip for the night. Atthe end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped and Tomslipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk landing fifty yardsdownstream out of danger of possible stragglers.He flew along unfrequented alleys and shortly found himself at hisaunts back fence. He climbed over approached the ell and looked inat the sittingroom window for a light was burning there. There satAunt Polly Sid Mary and Joe Harpers mother grouped togethertalking. They were by the bed and the bed was between them and thedoor. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch then hepressed gently and the door yielded a crack he continued pushingcautiously and quaking every time it creaked till he judged he mightsqueeze through on his knees so he put his head through and beganwarily.What makes the candle blow so said Aunt Polly. Tom hurried up.Why that doors open I believe. Why of course it is. No end ofstrange things now. Go long and shut it Sid.Tom disappeared under the bed just in time. He lay and breathedhimself for a time and then crept to where he could almost touch hisaunts foot.But as I was saying said Aunt Polly he warnt BAD so to say only mischEEvous. Only just giddy and harumscarum you know. Hewarnt any more responsible than a colt. HE never meant any harm andhe was the besthearted boy that ever was and she began to cry.It was just so with my Joe always full of his devilment and up toevery kind of mischief but he was just as unselfish and kind as hecould be and laws bless me to think I went and whipped him for takingthat cream never once recollecting that I throwed it out myselfbecause it was sour and I never to see him again in this world nevernever never poor abused boy And Mrs. Harper sobbed as if her heartwould break.I hope Toms better off where he is said Sid but if hed beenbetter in some ways SID Tom felt the glare of the old ladys eye though he could notsee it. Not a word against my Tom now that hes gone Godll takecare of HIM never you trouble YOURself sir Oh Mrs. Harper I dontknow how to give him up I dont know how to give him up He was such acomfort to me although he tormented my old heart out of me most.The Lord giveth and the Lord hath taken away Blessed be the name ofthe Lord But its so hard Oh its so hard Only last Saturday myJoe busted a firecracker right under my nose and I knocked himsprawling. Little did I know then how soon Oh if it was to do overagain Id hug him and bless him for it.Yes yes yes I know just how you feel Mrs. Harper I know justexactly how you feel. No longer ago than yesterday noon my Tom tookand filled the cat full of Painkiller and I did think the creturwould tear the house down. And God forgive me I cracked Toms headwith my thimble poor boy poor dead boy. But hes out of all histroubles now. And the last words I ever heard him say was to reproach But this memory was too much for the old lady and she broke entirelydown. Tom was snuffling now himself and more in pity of himself thananybody else. He could hear Mary crying and putting in a kindly wordfor him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himselfthan ever before. Still he was sufficiently touched by his auntsgrief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her withjoy and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly tohis nature too but he resisted and lay still.He went on listening and gathered by odds and ends that it wasconjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swimthen the small raft had been missed next certain boys said themissing lads had promised that the village should hear somethingsoon the wiseheads had put this and that together and decided thatthe lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next townbelow presently but toward noon the raft had been found lodgedagainst the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village and then hope perished they must be drowned else hunger would havedriven them home by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that thesearch for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because thedrowning must have occurred in midchannel since the boys being goodswimmers would otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesdaynight. If the bodies continued missing until Sunday all hope would begiven over and the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tomshuddered.Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing goodnight and turned to go. Then with amutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into eachothers arms and had a good consoling cry and then parted. Aunt Pollywas tender far beyond her wont in her goodnight to Sid and Mary. Sidsnuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.Aunt Polly knelt down and prayed for Tom so touchingly soappealingly and with such measureless love in her words and her oldtrembling voice that he was weltering in tears again long before shewas through.He had to keep still long after she went to bed for she kept makingbrokenhearted ejaculations from time to time tossing unrestfully andturning over. But at last she was still only moaning a little in hersleep. Now the boy stole out rose gradually by the bedside shaded thecandlelight with his hand and stood regarding her. His heart was fullof pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by thecandle. But something occurred to him and he lingered considering. Hisface lighted with a happy solution of his thought he put the barkhastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips andstraightway made his stealthy exit latching the door behind him.He threaded his way back to the ferry landing found nobody at largethere and walked boldly on board the boat for he knew she wastenantless except that there was a watchman who always turned in andslept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern slippedinto it and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled amile above the village he started quartering across and bent himselfstoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly forthis was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture theskiff arguing that it might be considered a ship and thereforelegitimate prey for a pirate but he knew a thorough search would bemade for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore andentered the woods.He sat down and took a long rest torturing himself meanwhile to keepawake and then started warily down the homestretch. The night was farspent. It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast theisland bar. He rested again until the sun was well up and gilding thegreat river with its splendor and then he plunged into the stream. Alittle later he paused dripping upon the threshold of the camp andheard Joe sayNo Toms trueblue Huck and hell come back. He wont desert. Heknows that would be a disgrace to a pirate and Toms too proud forthat sort of thing. Hes up to something or other. Now I wonder whatWell the things is ours anyway aint theyPretty near but not yet Huck. The writing says they are if he aintback here to breakfast.Which he is exclaimed Tom with fine dramatic effect steppinggrandly into camp.A sumptuous breakfast of bacon and fish was shortly provided and asthe boys set to work upon it Tom recounted and adorned hisadventures. They were a vain and boastful company of heroes when thetale was done. Then Tom hid himself away in a shady nook to sleep tillnoon and the other pirates got ready to fish and explore.CHAPTER XVIAFTER dinner all the gang turned out to hunt for turtle eggs on thebar. They went about poking sticks into the sand and when they found asoft place they went down on their knees and dug with their hands.Sometimes they would take fifty or sixty eggs out of one hole. Theywere perfectly round white things a trifle smaller than an Englishwalnut. They had a famous friedegg feast that night and another onFriday morning.After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar andchased each other round and round shedding clothes as they went untilthey were naked and then continued the frolic far away up the shoalwater of the bar against the stiff current which latter tripped theirlegs from under them from time to time and greatly increased the fun.And now and then they stooped in a group and splashed water in eachothers faces with their palms gradually approaching each other withaverted faces to avoid the strangling sprays and finally gripping andstruggling till the best man ducked his neighbor and then they allwent under in a tangle of white legs and arms and came up blowingsputtering laughing and gasping for breath at one and the same time.When they were well exhausted they would run out and sprawl on thedry hot sand and lie there and cover themselves up with it and byand by break for the water again and go through the originalperformance once more. Finally it occurred to them that their nakedskin represented fleshcolored tights very fairly so they drew aring in the sand and had a circus with three clowns in it for nonewould yield this proudest post to his neighbor.Next they got their marbles and played knucks and ringtaw andkeeps till that amusement grew stale. Then Joe and Huck had anotherswim but Tom would not venture because he found that in kicking offhis trousers he had kicked his string of rattlesnake rattles off hisankle and he wondered how he had escaped cramp so long without theprotection of this mysterious charm. He did not venture again until hehad found it and by that time the other boys were tired and ready torest. They gradually wandered apart dropped into the dumps and fellto gazing longingly across the wide river to where the village laydrowsing in the sun. Tom found himself writing BECKY in the sand withhis big toe he scratched it out and was angry with himself for hisweakness. But he wrote it again nevertheless he could not help it. Heerased it once more and then took himself out of temptation by drivingthe other boys together and joining them.But Joes spirits had gone down almost beyond resurrection. He was sohomesick that he could hardly endure the misery of it. The tears layvery near the surface. Huck was melancholy too. Tom was downheartedbut tried hard not to show it. He had a secret which he was not readyto tell yet but if this mutinous depression was not broken up soonhe would have to bring it out. He said with a great show ofcheerfulnessI bet theres been pirates on this island before boys. Well exploreit again. Theyve hid treasures here somewhere. Howd you feel to lighton a rotten chest full of gold and silver heyBut it roused only faint enthusiasm which faded out with no reply.Tom tried one or two other seductions but they failed too. It wasdiscouraging work. Joe sat poking up the sand with a stick and lookingvery gloomy. Finally he saidOh boys lets give it up. I want to go home. Its so lonesome.Oh no Joe youll feel better by and by said Tom. Just think ofthe fishing thats here.I dont care for fishing. I want to go home.But Joe there aint such another swimmingplace anywhere.Swimmings no good. I dont seem to care for it somehow when thereaint anybody to say I shant go in. I mean to go home.Oh shucks Baby You want to see your mother I reckon.Yes I DO want to see my mother and you would too if you had one.I aint any more baby than you are. And Joe snuffled a little.Well well let the crybaby go home to his mother wont we HuckPoor thing does it want to see its mother And so it shall. You likeit here dont you Huck Well stay wont weHuck said Yes without any heart in it.Ill never speak to you again as long as I live said Joe rising.There now And he moved moodily away and began to dress himself.Who cares said Tom. Nobody wants you to. Go long home and getlaughed at. Oh youre a nice pirate. Huck and me aint crybabies.Well stay wont we Huck Let him go if he wants to. I reckon we canget along without him peraps.But Tom was uneasy nevertheless and was alarmed to see Joe gosullenly on with his dressing. And then it was discomforting to seeHuck eying Joes preparations so wistfully and keeping up such anominous silence. Presently without a parting word Joe began to wadeoff toward the Illinois shore. Toms heart began to sink. He glanced atHuck. Huck could not bear the look and dropped his eyes. Then he saidI want to go too Tom. It was getting so lonesome anyway and nowitll be worse. Lets us go too Tom.I wont You can all go if you want to. I mean to stay.Tom I better go.Well go long whos hendering you.Huck began to pick up his scattered clothes. He saidTom I wisht youd come too. Now you think it over. Well wait foryou when we get to shore.Well youll wait a blame long time thats all.Huck started sorrowfully away and Tom stood looking after him with astrong desire tugging at his heart to yield his pride and go along too.He hoped the boys would stop but they still waded slowly on. Itsuddenly dawned on Tom that it was become very lonely and still. Hemade one final struggle with his pride and then darted after hiscomrades yellingWait Wait I want to tell you somethingThey presently stopped and turned around. When he got to where theywere he began unfolding his secret and they listened moodily till atlast they saw the point he was driving at and then they set up awarwhoop of applause and said it was splendid and said if he hadtold them at first they wouldnt have started away. He made a plausibleexcuse but his real reason had been the fear that not even the secretwould keep them with him any very great length of time and so he hadmeant to hold it in reserve as a last seduction.The lads came gayly back and went at their sports again with a willchattering all the time about Toms stupendous plan and admiring thegenius of it. After a dainty egg and fish dinner Tom said he wanted tolearn to smoke now. Joe caught at the idea and said he would like totry too. So Huck made pipes and filled them. These novices had neversmoked anything before but cigars made of grapevine and they bitthe tongue and were not considered manly anyway.Now they stretched themselves out on their elbows and began to puffcharily and with slender confidence. The smoke had an unpleasanttaste and they gagged a little but Tom saidWhy its just as easy If Id a knowed this was all Id a learntlong ago.So would I said Joe. Its just nothing.Why many a time Ive looked at people smoking and thought well Iwish I could do that but I never thought I could said Tom.Thats just the way with me haint it Huck Youve heard me talkjust that way havent you Huck Ill leave it to Huck if I havent.Yes heaps of times said Huck.Well I have too said Tom oh hundreds of times. Once down by theslaughterhouse. Dont you remember Huck Bob Tanner was there andJohnny Miller and Jeff Thatcher when I said it. Dont you rememberHuck bout me saying thatYes thats so said Huck. That was the day after I lost a whitealley. No twas the day before.There I told you so said Tom. Huck recollects it.I bleeve I could smoke this pipe all day said Joe. I dont feelsick.Neither do I said Tom. I could smoke it all day. But I bet youJeff Thatcher couldnt.Jeff Thatcher Why hed keel over just with two draws. Just let himtry it once. HED seeI bet he would. And Johnny Miller I wish could see Johnny Millertackle it once.Oh dont I said Joe. Why I bet you Johnny Miller couldnt anymore do this than nothing. Just one little snifter would fetch HIM.Deed it would Joe. Say I wish the boys could see us now.So do I.Say boys dont say anything about it and some time when theyrearound Ill come up to you and say Joe got a pipe I want a smoke.And youll say kind of careless like as if it warnt anything youllsay Yes I got my OLD pipe and another one but my tobacker aintvery good. And Ill say Oh thats all right if its STRONGenough. And then youll out with the pipes and well light up just ascam and then just see em lookBy jings thatll be gay Tom I wish it was NOWSo do I And when we tell em we learned when we was off piratingwont they wish theyd been alongOh I reckon not Ill just BET they willSo the talk ran on. But presently it began to flag a trifle and growdisjointed. The silences widened the expectoration marvellouslyincreased. Every pore inside the boys cheeks became a spoutingfountain they could scarcely bail out the cellars under their tonguesfast enough to prevent an inundation little overflowings down theirthroats occurred in spite of all they could do and sudden retchingsfollowed every time. Both boys were looking very pale and miserablenow. Joes pipe dropped from his nerveless fingers. Toms followed.Both fountains were going furiously and both pumps bailing with mightand main. Joe said feeblyIve lost my knife. I reckon I better go and find it.Tom said with quivering lips and halting utteranceIll help you. You go over that way and Ill hunt around by thespring. No you neednt come Huck we can find it.So Huck sat down again and waited an hour. Then he found it lonesomeand went to find his comrades. They were wide apart in the woods bothvery pale both fast asleep. But something informed him that if theyhad had any trouble they had got rid of it.They were not talkative at supper that night. They had a humble lookand when Huck prepared his pipe after the meal and was going to preparetheirs they said no they were not feeling very well something theyate at dinner had disagreed with them.About midnight Joe awoke and called the boys. There was a broodingoppressiveness in the air that seemed to bode something. The boyshuddled themselves together and sought the friendly companionship ofthe fire though the dull dead heat of the breathless atmosphere wasstifling. They sat still intent and waiting. The solemn hushcontinued. Beyond the light of the fire everything was swallowed up inthe blackness of darkness. Presently there came a quivering glow thatvaguely revealed the foliage for a moment and then vanished. By and byanother came a little stronger. Then another. Then a faint moan camesighing through the branches of the forest and the boys felt a fleetingbreath upon their cheeks and shuddered with the fancy that the Spiritof the Night had gone by. There was a pause. Now a weird flash turnednight into day and showed every little grassblade separate anddistinct that grew about their feet. And it showed three whitestartled faces too. A deep peal of thunder went rolling and tumblingdown the heavens and lost itself in sullen rumblings in the distance. Asweep of chilly air passed by rustling all the leaves and snowing theflaky ashes broadcast about the fire. Another fierce glare lit up theforest and an instant crash followed that seemed to rend the treetopsright over the boys heads. They clung together in terror in the thickgloom that followed. A few big raindrops fell pattering upon theleaves.Quick boys go for the tent exclaimed Tom.They sprang away stumbling over roots and among vines in the dark notwo plunging in the same direction. A furious blast roared through thetrees making everything sing as it went. One blinding flash afteranother came and peal on peal of deafening thunder. And now adrenching rain poured down and the rising hurricane drove it in sheetsalong the ground. The boys cried out to each other but the roaringwind and the booming thunderblasts drowned their voices utterly.However one by one they straggled in at last and took shelter underthe tent cold scared and streaming with water but to have companyin misery seemed something to be grateful for. They could not talk theold sail flapped so furiously even if the other noises would haveallowed them. The tempest rose higher and higher and presently thesail tore loose from its fastenings and went winging away on the blast.The boys seized each others hands and fled with many tumblings andbruises to the shelter of a great oak that stood upon the riverbank.Now the battle was at its highest. Under the ceaseless conflagration oflightning that flamed in the skies everything below stood out incleancut and shadowless distinctness the bending trees the billowyriver white with foam the driving spray of spumeflakes the dimoutlines of the high bluffs on the other side glimpsed through thedrifting cloudrack and the slanting veil of rain. Every little whilesome giant tree yielded the fight and fell crashing through the youngergrowth and the unflagging thunderpeals came now in earsplittingexplosive bursts keen and sharp and unspeakably appalling. The stormculminated in one matchless effort that seemed likely to tear the islandto pieces burn it up drown it to the treetops blow it away anddeafen every creature in it all at one and the same moment. It was awild night for homeless young heads to be out in.But at last the battle was done and the forces retired with weakerand weaker threatenings and grumblings and peace resumed her sway. Theboys went back to camp a good deal awed but they found there wasstill something to be thankful for because the great sycamore theshelter of their beds was a ruin now blasted by the lightnings andthey were not under it when the catastrophe happened.Everything in camp was drenched the campfire as well for they werebut heedless lads like their generation and had made no provisionagainst rain. Here was matter for dismay for they were soaked throughand chilled. They were eloquent in their distress but they presentlydiscovered that the fire had eaten so far up under the great log it hadbeen built against where it curved upward and separated itself fromthe ground that a handbreadth or so of it had escaped wetting sothey patiently wrought until with shreds and bark gathered from theunder sides of sheltered logs they coaxed the fire to burn again. Thenthey piled on great dead boughs till they had a roaring furnace andwere gladhearted once more. They dried their boiled ham and had afeast and after that they sat by the fire and expanded and glorifiedtheir midnight adventure until morning for there was not a dry spot tosleep on anywhere around.As the sun began to steal in upon the boys drowsiness came over themand they went out on the sandbar and lay down to sleep. They gotscorched out by and by and drearily set about getting breakfast. Afterthe meal they felt rusty and stiffjointed and a little homesick oncemore. Tom saw the signs and fell to cheering up the pirates as well ashe could. But they cared nothing for marbles or circus or swimmingor anything. He reminded them of the imposing secret and raised a rayof cheer. While it lasted he got them interested in a new device. Thiswas to knock off being pirates for a while and be Indians for achange. They were attracted by this idea so it was not long beforethey were stripped and striped from head to heel with black mud likeso many zebras all of them chiefs of course and then they wenttearing through the woods to attack an English settlement.By and by they separated into three hostile tribes and darted uponeach other from ambush with dreadful warwhoops and killed and scalpedeach other by thousands. It was a gory day. Consequently it was anextremely satisfactory one.They assembled in camp toward suppertime hungry and happy but now adifficulty arose hostile Indians could not break the bread ofhospitality together without first making peace and this was a simpleimpossibility without smoking a pipe of peace. There was no otherprocess that ever they had heard of. Two of the savages almost wishedthey had remained pirates. However there was no other way so withsuch show of cheerfulness as they could muster they called for the pipeand took their whiff as it passed in due form.And behold they were glad they had gone into savagery for they hadgained something they found that they could now smoke a little withouthaving to go and hunt for a lost knife they did not get sick enough tobe seriously uncomfortable. They were not likely to fool away this highpromise for lack of effort. No they practised cautiously aftersupper with right fair success and so they spent a jubilant evening.They were prouder and happier in their new acquirement than they wouldhave been in the scalping and skinning of the Six Nations. We willleave them to smoke and chatter and brag since we have no further usefor them at present.CHAPTER XVIIBUT there was no hilarity in the little town that same tranquilSaturday afternoon. The Harpers and Aunt Pollys family were beingput into mourning with great grief and many tears. An unusual quietpossessed the village although it was ordinarily quiet enough in allconscience. The villagers conducted their concerns with an absent airand talked little but they sighed often. The Saturday holiday seemed aburden to the children. They had no heart in their sports andgradually gave them up.In the afternoon Becky Thatcher found herself moping about thedeserted schoolhouse yard and feeling very melancholy. But she foundnothing there to comfort her. She soliloquizedOh if I only had a brass andironknob again But I havent gotanything now to remember him by. And she choked back a little sob.Presently she stopped and said to herselfIt was right here. Oh if it was to do over again I wouldnt saythat I wouldnt say it for the whole world. But hes gone now Illnever never never see him any more.This thought broke her down and she wandered away with tears rollingdown her cheeks. Then quite a group of boys and girls playmates ofToms and Joes came by and stood looking over the paling fence andtalking in reverent tones of how Tom did soandso the last time theysaw him and how Joe said this and that small trifle pregnant withawful prophecy as they could easily see now and each speakerpointed out the exact spot where the lost lads stood at the time andthen added something like and I was astanding just so just as I amnow and as if you was him I was as close as that and he smiled justthis way and then something seemed to go all over me like awful youknow and I never thought what it meant of course but I can see nowThen there was a dispute about who saw the dead boys last in life andmany claimed that dismal distinction and offered evidences more orless tampered with by the witness and when it was ultimately decidedwho DID see the departed last and exchanged the last words with themthe lucky parties took upon themselves a sort of sacred importance andwere gaped at and envied by all the rest. One poor chap who had noother grandeur to offer said with tolerably manifest pride in theremembranceWell Tom Sawyer he licked me once.But that bid for glory was a failure. Most of the boys could say thatand so that cheapened the distinction too much. The group loiteredaway still recalling memories of the lost heroes in awed voices.When the Sundayschool hour was finished the next morning the bellbegan to toll instead of ringing in the usual way. It was a very stillSabbath and the mournful sound seemed in keeping with the musing hushthat lay upon nature. The villagers began to gather loitering a momentin the vestibule to converse in whispers about the sad event. But therewas no whispering in the house only the funereal rustling of dressesas the women gathered to their seats disturbed the silence there. Nonecould remember when the little church had been so full before. Therewas finally a waiting pause an expectant dumbness and then Aunt Pollyentered followed by Sid and Mary and they by the Harper family allin deep black and the whole congregation the old minister as wellrose reverently and stood until the mourners were seated in the frontpew. There was another communing silence broken at intervals bymuffled sobs and then the minister spread his hands abroad and prayed.A moving hymn was sung and the text followed I am the Resurrectionand the Life.As the service proceeded the clergyman drew such pictures of thegraces the winning ways and the rare promise of the lost lads thatevery soul there thinking he recognized these pictures felt a pang inremembering that he had persistently blinded himself to them alwaysbefore and had as persistently seen only faults and flaws in the poorboys. The minister related many a touching incident in the lives of thedeparted too which illustrated their sweet generous natures and thepeople could easily see now how noble and beautiful those episodeswere and remembered with grief that at the time they occurred they hadseemed rank rascalities well deserving of the cowhide. Thecongregation became more and more moved as the pathetic tale went ontill at last the whole company broke down and joined the weepingmourners in a chorus of anguished sobs the preacher himself giving wayto his feelings and crying in the pulpit.There was a rustle in the gallery which nobody noticed a momentlater the church door creaked the minister raised his streaming eyesabove his handkerchief and stood transfixed First one and thenanother pair of eyes followed the ministers and then almost with oneimpulse the congregation rose and stared while the three dead boys camemarching up the aisle Tom in the lead Joe next and Huck a ruin ofdrooping rags sneaking sheepishly in the rear They had been hid inthe unused gallery listening to their own funeral sermonAunt Polly Mary and the Harpers threw themselves upon their restoredones smothered them with kisses and poured out thanksgivings whilepoor Huck stood abashed and uncomfortable not knowing exactly what todo or where to hide from so many unwelcoming eyes. He wavered andstarted to slink away but Tom seized him and saidAunt Polly it aint fair. Somebodys got to be glad to see Huck.And so they shall. Im glad to see him poor motherless thing Andthe loving attentions Aunt Polly lavished upon him were the one thingcapable of making him more uncomfortable than he was before.Suddenly the minister shouted at the top of his voice Praise Godfrom whom all blessings flow SING and put your hearts in itAnd they did. Old Hundred swelled up with a triumphant burst andwhile it shook the rafters Tom Sawyer the Pirate looked around upon theenvying juveniles about him and confessed in his heart that this wasthe proudest moment of his life.As the sold congregation trooped out they said they would almost bewilling to be made ridiculous again to hear Old Hundred sung like thatonce more.Tom got more cuffs and kisses that day according to Aunt Pollysvarying moods than he had earned before in a year and he hardly knewwhich expressed the most gratefulness to God and affection for himself.CHAPTER XVIIITHAT was Toms great secret the scheme to return home with hisbrother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over tothe Missouri shore on a log at dusk on Saturday landing five or sixmiles below the village they had slept in the woods at the edge of thetown till nearly daylight and had then crept through back lanes andalleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among achaos of invalided benches.At breakfast Monday morning Aunt Polly and Mary were very loving toTom and very attentive to his wants. There was an unusual amount oftalk. In the course of it Aunt Polly saidWell I dont say it wasnt a fine joke Tom to keep everybodysuffering most a week so you boys had a good time but it is a pityyou could be so hardhearted as to let me suffer so. If you could comeover on a log to go to your funeral you could have come over and giveme a hint some way that you warnt dead but only run off.Yes you could have done that Tom said Mary and I believe youwould if you had thought of it.Would you Tom said Aunt Polly her face lighting wistfully. Saynow would you if youd thought of itI well I dont know. Twould a spoiled everything.Tom I hoped you loved me that much said Aunt Polly with a grievedtone that discomforted the boy. It would have been something if youdcared enough to THINK of it even if you didnt DO it.Now auntie that aint any harm pleaded Mary its only Tomsgiddy way he is always in such a rush that he never thinks ofanything.Mores the pity. Sid would have thought. And Sid would have come andDONE it too. Tom youll look back some day when its too late andwish youd cared a little more for me when it would have cost you solittle.Now auntie you know I do care for you said Tom.Id know it better if you acted more like it.I wish now Id thought said Tom with a repentant tone but Idreamt about you anyway. Thats something aint itIt aint much a cat does that much but its better than nothing.What did you dreamWhy Wednesday night I dreamt that you was sitting over there by thebed and Sid was sitting by the woodbox and Mary next to him.Well so we did. So we always do. Im glad your dreams could takeeven that much trouble about us.And I dreamt that Joe Harpers mother was here.Why she was here Did you dream any moreOh lots. But its so dim now.Well try to recollect cant youSomehow it seems to me that the wind the wind blowed the the Try harder Tom The wind did blow something. ComeTom pressed his fingers on his forehead an anxious minute and thensaidIve got it now Ive got it now It blowed the candleMercy on us Go on Tom go onAnd it seems to me that you said Why I believe that that door Go ON TomJust let me study a moment just a moment. Oh yes you said youbelieved the door was open.As Im sitting here I did Didnt I Mary Go onAnd then and then well I wont be certain but it seems like as ifyou made Sid go and and Well Well What did I make him do Tom What did I make him doYou made him you Oh you made him shut it.Well for the lands sake I never heard the beat of that in all mydays Dont tell ME there aint anything in dreams any more. SerenyHarper shall know of this before Im an hour older. Id like to see herget around THIS with her rubbage bout superstition. Go on TomOh its all getting just as bright as day now. Next you said Iwarnt BAD only mischeevous and harumscarum and not any moreresponsible than than I think it was a colt or something.And so it was Well goodness gracious Go on TomAnd then you began to cry.So I did. So I did. Not the first time neither. And then Then Mrs. Harper she began to cry and said Joe was just the sameand she wished she hadnt whipped him for taking cream when shedthrowed it out her own self Tom The sperrit was upon you You was a prophesying thats what youwas doing Land alive go on TomThen Sid he said he said I dont think I said anything said Sid.Yes you did Sid said Mary.Shut your heads and let Tom go on What did he say TomHe said I THINK he said he hoped I was better off where I was goneto but if Id been better sometimes THERE dyou hear that It was his very wordsAnd you shut him up sharp.I lay I did There must a been an angel there. There WAS an angelthere somewheresAnd Mrs. Harper told about Joe scaring her with a firecracker andyou told about Peter and the Painkiller Just as true as I liveAnd then there was a whole lot of talk bout dragging the river forus and bout having the funeral Sunday and then you and old MissHarper hugged and cried and she went.It happened just so It happened just so as sure as Im asitting inthese very tracks. Tom you couldnt told it more like if youd aseen it And then what Go on TomThen I thought you prayed for me and I could see you and hear everyword you said. And you went to bed and I was so sorry that I took andwrote on a piece of sycamore bark We aint dead we are only offbeing pirates and put it on the table by the candle and then youlooked so good laying there asleep that I thought I went and leanedover and kissed you on the lips.Did you Tom DID you I just forgive you everything for that Andshe seized the boy in a crushing embrace that made him feel like theguiltiest of villains.It was very kind even though it was only a dream Sid soliloquizedjust audibly.Shut up Sid A body does just the same in a dream as hed do if hewas awake. Heres a big Milum apple Ive been saving for you Tom ifyou was ever found again now go long to school. Im thankful to thegood God and Father of us all Ive got you back thats longsufferingand merciful to them that believe on Him and keep His word thoughgoodness knows Im unworthy of it but if only the worthy ones got Hisblessings and had His hand to help them over the rough places theresfew enough would smile here or ever enter into His rest when the longnight comes. Go long Sid Mary Tom take yourselves off youvehendered me long enough.The children left for school and the old lady to call on Mrs. Harperand vanquish her realism with Toms marvellous dream. Sid had betterjudgment than to utter the thought that was in his mind as he left thehouse. It was this Pretty thin as long a dream as that without anymistakes in itWhat a hero Tom was become now He did not go skipping and prancingbut moved with a dignified swagger as became a pirate who felt that thepublic eye was on him. And indeed it was he tried not to seem to seethe looks or hear the remarks as he passed along but they were foodand drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels asproud to be seen with him and tolerated by him as if he had been thedrummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerieinto town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been awayat all but they were consuming with envy nevertheless. They wouldhave given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his and hisglittering notoriety and Tom would not have parted with either for acircus.At school the children made so much of him and of Joe and deliveredsuch eloquent admiration from their eyes that the two heroes were notlong in becoming insufferably stuckup. They began to tell theiradventures to hungry listeners but they only began it was not a thinglikely to have an end with imaginations like theirs to furnishmaterial. And finally when they got out their pipes and went serenelypuffing around the very summit of glory was reached.Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glorywas sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguishedmaybe she would be wanting to make up. Well let her she should seethat he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently shearrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a groupof boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she wastripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyespretending to be busy chasing schoolmates and screaming with laughterwhen she made a capture but he noticed that she always made hercaptures in his vicinity and that she seemed to cast a conscious eyein his direction at such times too. It gratified all the viciousvanity that was in him and so instead of winning him it only sethim up the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying thathe knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking and movedirresolutely about sighing once or twice and glancing furtively andwistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking moreparticularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharppang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away buther feet were treacherous and carried her to the group instead. Shesaid to a girl almost at Toms elbow with sham vivacityWhy Mary Austin you bad girl why didnt you come to SundayschoolI did come didnt you see meWhy no Did you Where did you sitI was in Miss Peters class where I always go. I saw YOU.Did you Why its funny I didnt see you. I wanted to tell you aboutthe picnic.Oh thats jolly. Whos going to give itMy mas going to let me have one.Oh goody I hope shell let ME come.Well she will. The picnics for me. Shell let anybody come that Iwant and I want you.Thats ever so nice. When is it going to beBy and by. Maybe about vacation.Oh wont it be fun You going to have all the girls and boysYes every one thats friends to me or wants to be and she glancedever so furtively at Tom but he talked right along to Amy Lawrenceabout the terrible storm on the island and how the lightning tore thegreat sycamore tree all to flinders while he was standing withinthree feet of it.Oh may I come said Grace Miller.Yes.And me said Sally Rogers.Yes.And me too said Susy Harper. And JoeYes.And so on with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had beggedfor invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away stilltalking and took Amy with him. Beckys lips trembled and the tearscame to her eyes she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went onchattering but the life had gone out of the picnic now and out ofeverything else she got away as soon as she could and hid herself andhad what her sex call a good cry. Then she sat moody with woundedpride till the bell rang. She roused up now with a vindictive castin her eye and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew whatSHED do.At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilantselfsatisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerateher with the performance. At last he spied her but there was a suddenfalling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behindthe schoolhouse looking at a picturebook with Alfred Temple and soabsorbed were they and their heads so close together over the bookthat they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides.Jealousy ran redhot through Toms veins. He began to hate himself forthrowing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. Hecalled himself a fool and all the hard names he could think of. Hewanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along as they walkedfor her heart was singing but Toms tongue had lost its function. Hedid not hear what Amy was saying and whenever she paused expectantly hecould only stammer an awkward assent which was as often misplaced asotherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse again andagain to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He couldnot help it. And it maddened him to see as he thought he saw thatBecky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of theliving. But she did see nevertheless and she knew she was winning herfight too and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.Amys happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had toattend to things that must be done and time was fleeting. But invain the girl chirped on. Tom thought Oh hang her aint I evergoing to get rid of her At last he must be attending to thosethings and she said artlessly that she would be around when schoollet out. And he hastened away hating her for it.Any other boy Tom thought grating his teeth. Any boy in the wholetown but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and isaristocracy Oh all right I licked you the first day you ever sawthis town mister and Ill lick you again You just wait till I catchyou out Ill just take and And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy pummelling the air and kicking and gouging. Oh you do do you Youholler nough do you Now then let that learn you And so theimaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more ofAmys grateful happiness and his jealousy could bear no more of theother distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred butas the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer her triumphbegan to cloud and she lost interest gravity and absentmindednessfollowed and then melancholy two or three times she pricked up herear at a footstep but it was a false hope no Tom came. At last shegrew entirely miserable and wished she hadnt carried it so far. Whenpoor Alfred seeing that he was losing her he did not know how keptexclaiming Oh heres a jolly one look at this she lost patienceat last and said Oh dont bother me I dont care for them andburst into tears and got up and walked away.Alfred dropped alongside and was going to try to comfort her but shesaidGo away and leave me alone cant you I hate youSo the boy halted wondering what he could have done for she had saidshe would look at pictures all through the nooning and she walked oncrying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He washumiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth the girlhad simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer.He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him.He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without muchrisk to himself. Toms spellingbook fell under his eye. Here was hisopportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon andpoured ink upon the page.Becky glancing in at a window behind him at the moment saw the actand moved on without discovering herself. She started homeward nowintending to find Tom and tell him Tom would be thankful and theirtroubles would be healed. Before she was half way home however shehad changed her mind. The thought of Toms treatment of her when shewas talking about her picnic came scorching back and filled her withshame. She resolved to let him get whipped on the damagedspellingbooks account and to hate him forever into the bargain.CHAPTER XIXTOM arrived at home in a dreary mood and the first thing his auntsaid to him showed him that he had brought his sorrows to anunpromising marketTom Ive a notion to skin you aliveAuntie what have I doneWell youve done enough. Here I go over to Sereny Harper like anold softy expecting Im going to make her believe all that rubbageabout that dream when lo and behold you shed found out from Joe thatyou was over here and heard all the talk we had that night. Tom Idont know what is to become of a boy that will act like that. It makesme feel so bad to think you could let me go to Sereny Harper and makesuch a fool of myself and never say a word.This was a new aspect of the thing. His smartness of the morning hadseemed to Tom a good joke before and very ingenious. It merely lookedmean and shabby now. He hung his head and could not think of anythingto say for a moment. Then he saidAuntie I wish I hadnt done it but I didnt think.Oh child you never think. You never think of anything but your ownselfishness. You could think to come all the way over here fromJacksons Island in the night to laugh at our troubles and you couldthink to fool me with a lie about a dream but you couldnt ever thinkto pity us and save us from sorrow.Auntie I know now it was mean but I didnt mean to be mean. Ididnt honest. And besides I didnt come over here to laugh at youthat night.What did you come for thenIt was to tell you not to be uneasy about us because we hadnt gotdrownded.Tom Tom I would be the thankfullest soul in this world if I couldbelieve you ever had as good a thought as that but you know you neverdid and I know it Tom.Indeed and deed I did auntie I wish I may never stir if I didnt.Oh Tom dont lie dont do it. It only makes things a hundred timesworse.It aint a lie auntie its the truth. I wanted to keep you fromgrieving that was all that made me come.Id give the whole world to believe that it would cover up a powerof sins Tom. Id most be glad youd run off and acted so bad. But itaint reasonable because why didnt you tell me childWhy you see when you got to talking about the funeral I just gotall full of the idea of our coming and hiding in the church and Icouldnt somehow bear to spoil it. So I just put the bark back in mypocket and kept mum.What barkThe bark I had wrote on to tell you wed gone pirating. I wish nowyoud waked up when I kissed you I do honest.The hard lines in his aunts face relaxed and a sudden tendernessdawned in her eyes.DID you kiss me TomWhy yes I did.Are you sure you did TomWhy yes I did auntie certain sure.What did you kiss me for TomBecause I loved you so and you laid there moaning and I was so sorry.The words sounded like truth. The old lady could not hide a tremor inher voice when she saidKiss me again Tom and be off with you to school now and dontbother me any more.The moment he was gone she ran to a closet and got out the ruin of ajacket which Tom had gone pirating in. Then she stopped with it in herhand and said to herselfNo I dont dare. Poor boy I reckon hes lied about it but its ablessed blessed lie theres such a comfort come from it. I hope theLord I KNOW the Lord will forgive him because it was suchgoodheartedness in him to tell it. But I dont want to find out its alie. I wont look.She put the jacket away and stood by musing a minute. Twice she putout her hand to take the garment again and twice she refrained. Oncemore she ventured and this time she fortified herself with thethought Its a good lie its a good lie I wont let it grieve me.So she sought the jacket pocket. A moment later she was reading Tomspiece of bark through flowing tears and saying I could forgive theboy now if hed committed a million sinsCHAPTER XXTHERE was something about Aunt Pollys manner when she kissed Tomthat swept away his low spirits and made him lighthearted and happyagain. He started to school and had the luck of coming upon BeckyThatcher at the head of Meadow Lane. His mood always determined hismanner. Without a moments hesitation he ran to her and saidI acted mighty mean today Becky and Im so sorry. I wont everever do that way again as long as ever I live please make up wontyouThe girl stopped and looked him scornfully in the faceIll thank you to keep yourself TO yourself Mr. Thomas Sawyer. Illnever speak to you again.She tossed her head and passed on. Tom was so stunned that he had noteven presence of mind enough to say Who cares Miss Smarty until theright time to say it had gone by. So he said nothing. But he was in afine rage nevertheless. He moped into the schoolyard wishing she werea boy and imagining how he would trounce her if she were. He presentlyencountered her and delivered a stinging remark as he passed. Shehurled one in return and the angry breach was complete. It seemed toBecky in her hot resentment that she could hardly wait for school totake in she was so impatient to see Tom flogged for the injuredspellingbook. If she had had any lingering notion of exposing AlfredTemple Toms offensive fling had driven it entirely away.Poor girl she did not know how fast she was nearing trouble herself.The master Mr. Dobbins had reached middle age with an unsatisfiedambition. The darling of his desires was to be a doctor but povertyhad decreed that he should be nothing higher than a villageschoolmaster. Every day he took a mysterious book out of his desk andabsorbed himself in it at times when no classes were reciting. He keptthat book under lock and key. There was not an urchin in school but wasperishing to have a glimpse of it but the chance never came. Every boyand girl had a theory about the nature of that book but no twotheories were alike and there was no way of getting at the facts inthe case. Now as Becky was passing by the desk which stood near thedoor she noticed that the key was in the lock It was a preciousmoment. She glanced around found herself alone and the next instantshe had the book in her hands. The titlepage Professor SomebodysANATOMY carried no information to her mind so she began to turn theleaves. She came at once upon a handsomely engraved and coloredfrontispiece a human figure stark naked. At that moment a shadow fellon the page and Tom Sawyer stepped in at the door and caught a glimpseof the picture. Becky snatched at the book to close it and had thehard luck to tear the pictured page half down the middle. She thrustthe volume into the desk turned the key and burst out crying withshame and vexation.Tom Sawyer you are just as mean as you can be to sneak up on aperson and look at what theyre looking at.How could I know you was looking at anythingYou ought to be ashamed of yourself Tom Sawyer you know youregoing to tell on me and oh what shall I do what shall I do Ill bewhipped and I never was whipped in school.Then she stamped her little foot and saidBE so mean if you want to I know something thats going to happen.You just wait and youll see Hateful hateful hateful and sheflung out of the house with a new explosion of crying.Tom stood still rather flustered by this onslaught. Presently he saidto himselfWhat a curious kind of a fool a girl is Never been licked in schoolShucks Whats a licking Thats just like a girl theyre sothinskinned and chickenhearted. Well of course I aint going to tellold Dobbins on this little fool because theres other ways of gettingeven on her that aint so mean but what of it Old Dobbins will askwho it was tore his book. Nobodyll answer. Then hell do just the wayhe always does ask first one and then tother and when he comes to theright girl hell know it without any telling. Girls faces always tellon them. They aint got any backbone. Shell get licked. Well its akind of a tight place for Becky Thatcher because there aint any wayout of it. Tom conned the thing a moment longer and then added Allright though shed like to see me in just such a fix let her sweat itoutTom joined the mob of skylarking scholars outside. In a few momentsthe master arrived and school took in. Tom did not feel a stronginterest in his studies. Every time he stole a glance at the girlsside of the room Beckys face troubled him. Considering all things hedid not want to pity her and yet it was all he could do to help it. Hecould get up no exultation that was really worthy the name. Presentlythe spellingbook discovery was made and Toms mind was entirely fullof his own matters for a while after that. Becky roused up from herlethargy of distress and showed good interest in the proceedings. Shedid not expect that Tom could get out of his trouble by denying that hespilt the ink on the book himself and she was right. The denial onlyseemed to make the thing worse for Tom. Becky supposed she would beglad of that and she tried to believe she was glad of it but shefound she was not certain. When the worst came to the worst she had animpulse to get up and tell on Alfred Temple but she made an effort andforced herself to keep still because said she to herself hell tellabout me tearing the picture sure. I wouldnt say a word not to savehis lifeTom took his whipping and went back to his seat not at allbrokenhearted for he thought it was possible that he had unknowinglyupset the ink on the spellingbook himself in some skylarking bout hehad denied it for forms sake and because it was custom and had stuckto the denial from principle.A whole hour drifted by the master sat nodding in his throne the airwas drowsy with the hum of study. By and by Mr. Dobbins straightenedhimself up yawned then unlocked his desk and reached for his bookbut seemed undecided whether to take it out or leave it. Most of thepupils glanced up languidly but there were two among them that watchedhis movements with intent eyes. Mr. Dobbins fingered his book absentlyfor a while then took it out and settled himself in his chair to readTom shot a glance at Becky. He had seen a hunted and helpless rabbitlook as she did with a gun levelled at its head. Instantly he forgothis quarrel with her. Quick something must be done done in a flashtoo But the very imminence of the emergency paralyzed his invention.Good he had an inspiration He would run and snatch the book springthrough the door and fly. But his resolution shook for one littleinstant and the chance was lost the master opened the volume. If Tomonly had the wasted opportunity back again Too late. There was no helpfor Becky now he said. The next moment the master faced the school.Every eye sank under his gaze. There was that in it which smote eventhe innocent with fear. There was silence while one might count ten the master was gathering his wrath. Then he spoke Who tore this bookThere was not a sound. One could have heard a pin drop. The stillnesscontinued the master searched face after face for signs of guilt.Benjamin Rogers did you tear this bookA denial. Another pause.Joseph Harper did youAnother denial. Toms uneasiness grew more and more intense under theslow torture of these proceedings. The master scanned the ranks ofboys considered a while then turned to the girlsAmy LawrenceA shake of the head.Gracie MillerThe same sign.Susan Harper did you do thisAnother negative. The next girl was Becky Thatcher. Tom was tremblingfrom head to foot with excitement and a sense of the hopelessness ofthe situation.Rebecca Thatcher Tom glanced at her face it was white with terror did you tear no look me in the face her hands rose in appeal did you tear this bookA thought shot like lightning through Toms brain. He sprang to hisfeet and shouted I done itThe school stared in perplexity at this incredible folly. Tom stood amoment to gather his dismembered faculties and when he steppedforward to go to his punishment the surprise the gratitude theadoration that shone upon him out of poor Beckys eyes seemed payenough for a hundred floggings. Inspired by the splendor of his ownact he took without an outcry the most merciless flaying that even Mr.Dobbins had ever administered and also received with indifference theadded cruelty of a command to remain two hours after school should bedismissed for he knew who would wait for him outside till hiscaptivity was done and not count the tedious time as loss either.Tom went to bed that night planning vengeance against Alfred Templefor with shame and repentance Becky had told him all not forgettingher own treachery but even the longing for vengeance had to give waysoon to pleasanter musings and he fell asleep at last with Beckyslatest words lingering dreamily in his ear Tom how COULD you be so nobleCHAPTER XXIVACATION was approaching. The schoolmaster always severe grewseverer and more exacting than ever for he wanted the school to make agood showing on Examination day. His rod and his ferule were seldomidle now at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys andyoung ladies of eighteen and twenty escaped lashing. Mr. Dobbinslashings were very vigorous ones too for although he carried underhis wig a perfectly bald and shiny head he had only reached middleage and there was no sign of feebleness in his muscle. As the greatday approached all the tyranny that was in him came to the surface heseemed to take a vindictive pleasure in punishing the leastshortcomings. The consequence was that the smaller boys spent theirdays in terror and suffering and their nights in plotting revenge. Theythrew away no opportunity to do the master a mischief. But he keptahead all the time. The retribution that followed every vengefulsuccess was so sweeping and majestic that the boys always retired fromthe field badly worsted. At last they conspired together and hit upon aplan that promised a dazzling victory. They swore in the signpaintersboy told him the scheme and asked his help. He had his own reasonsfor being delighted for the master boarded in his fathers family andhad given the boy ample cause to hate him. The masters wife would goon a visit to the country in a few days and there would be nothing tointerfere with the plan the master always prepared himself for greatoccasions by getting pretty well fuddled and the signpainters boysaid that when the dominie had reached the proper condition onExamination Evening he would manage the thing while he napped in hischair then he would have him awakened at the right time and hurriedaway to school.In the fulness of time the interesting occasion arrived. At eight inthe evening the schoolhouse was brilliantly lighted and adorned withwreaths and festoons of foliage and flowers. The master sat throned inhis great chair upon a raised platform with his blackboard behind him.He was looking tolerably mellow. Three rows of benches on each side andsix rows in front of him were occupied by the dignitaries of the townand by the parents of the pupils. To his left back of the rows ofcitizens was a spacious temporary platform upon which were seated thescholars who were to take part in the exercises of the evening rows ofsmall boys washed and dressed to an intolerable state of discomfortrows of gawky big boys snowbanks of girls and young ladies clad inlawn and muslin and conspicuously conscious of their bare arms theirgrandmothers ancient trinkets their bits of pink and blue ribbon andthe flowers in their hair. All the rest of the house was filled withnonparticipating scholars.The exercises began. A very little boy stood up and sheepishlyrecited Youd scarce expect one of my age to speak in public on thestage etc. accompanying himself with the painfully exact andspasmodic gestures which a machine might have used supposing themachine to be a trifle out of order. But he got through safely thoughcruelly scared and got a fine round of applause when he made hismanufactured bow and retired.A little shamefaced girl lisped Mary had a little lamb etc.performed a compassioninspiring curtsy got her meed of applause andsat down flushed and happy.Tom Sawyer stepped forward with conceited confidence and soared intothe unquenchable and indestructible Give me liberty or give me deathspeech with fine fury and frantic gesticulation and broke down in themiddle of it. A ghastly stagefright seized him his legs quaked underhim and he was like to choke. True he had the manifest sympathy of thehouse but he had the houses silence too which was even worse thanits sympathy. The master frowned and this completed the disaster. Tomstruggled awhile and then retired utterly defeated. There was a weakattempt at applause but it died early.The Boy Stood on the Burning Deck followed also The Assyrian CameDown and other declamatory gems. Then there were reading exercisesand a spelling fight. The meagre Latin class recited with honor. Theprime feature of the evening was in order now original compositionsby the young ladies. Each in her turn stepped forward to the edge ofthe platform cleared her throat held up her manuscript tied withdainty ribbon and proceeded to read with labored attention toexpression and punctuation. The themes were the same that had beenilluminated upon similar occasions by their mothers before them theirgrandmothers and doubtless all their ancestors in the female lineclear back to the Crusades. Friendship was one Memories of OtherDays Religion in History Dream Land The Advantages ofCulture Forms of Political Government Compared and ContrastedMelancholy Filial Love Heart Longings etc. etc.A prevalent feature in these compositions was a nursed and pettedmelancholy another was a wasteful and opulent gush of fine languageanother was a tendency to lug in by the ears particularly prized wordsand phrases until they were worn entirely out and a peculiarity thatconspicuously marked and marred them was the inveterate and intolerablesermon that wagged its crippled tail at the end of each and every oneof them. No matter what the subject might be a brainracking effortwas made to squirm it into some aspect or other that the moral andreligious mind could contemplate with edification. The glaringinsincerity of these sermons was not sufficient to compass thebanishment of the fashion from the schools and it is not sufficienttoday it never will be sufficient while the world stands perhaps.There is no school in all our land where the young ladies do not feelobliged to close their compositions with a sermon and you will findthat the sermon of the most frivolous and the least religious girl inthe school is always the longest and the most relentlessly pious. Butenough of this. Homely truth is unpalatable.Let us return to the Examination. The first composition that wasread was one entitled Is this then Life Perhaps the reader canendure an extract from it In the common walks of life with what delightful emotions does the youthful mind look forward to some anticipated scene of festivity Imagination is busy sketching rosetinted pictures of joy. In fancy the voluptuous votary of fashion sees herself amid the festive throng the observed of all observers. Her graceful form arrayed in snowy robes is whirling through the mazes of the joyous dance her eye is brightest her step is lightest in the gay assembly. In such delicious fancies time quickly glides by and the welcome hour arrives for her entrance into the Elysian world of which she has had such bright dreams. How fairylike does everything appear to her enchanted vision Each new scene is more charming than the last. But after a while she finds that beneath this goodly exterior all is vanity the flattery which once charmed her soul now grates harshly upon her ear the ballroom has lost its charms and with wasted health and imbittered heart she turns away with the conviction that earthly pleasures cannot satisfy the longings of the soulAnd so forth and so on. There was a buzz of gratification from time totime during the reading accompanied by whispered ejaculations of Howsweet How eloquent So true etc. and after the thing had closedwith a peculiarly afflicting sermon the applause was enthusiastic.Then arose a slim melancholy girl whose face had the interestingpaleness that comes of pills and indigestion and read a poem. Twostanzas of it will do A MISSOURI MAIDENS FAREWELL TO ALABAMA Alabama goodbye I love thee well But yet for a while do I leave thee now Sad yes sad thoughts of thee my heart doth swell And burning recollections throng my brow For I have wandered through thy flowery woods Have roamed and read near Tallapoosas stream Have listened to Tallassees warring floods And wooed on Coosas side Auroras beam. Yet shame I not to bear an oerfull heart Nor blush to turn behind my tearful eyes Tis from no stranger land I now must part Tis to no strangers left I yield these sighs. Welcome and home were mine within this State Whose vales I leave whose spires fade fast from me And cold must be mine eyes and heart and tete When dear Alabama they turn cold on theeThere were very few there who knew what tete meant but the poem wasvery satisfactory nevertheless.Next appeared a darkcomplexioned blackeyed blackhaired younglady who paused an impressive moment assumed a tragic expression andbegan to read in a measured solemn tone A VISION Dark and tempestuous was night. Around the throne on high not a single star quivered but the deep intonations of the heavy thunder constantly vibrated upon the ear whilst the terrific lightning revelled in angry mood through the cloudy chambers of heaven seeming to scorn the power exerted over its terror by the illustrious Franklin Even the boisterous winds unanimously came forth from their mystic homes and blustered about as if to enhance by their aid the wildness of the scene. At such a time so dark so dreary for human sympathy my very spirit sighed but instead thereof My dearest friend my counsellor my comforter and guide My joy in grief my second bliss in joy came to my side. She moved like one of those bright beings pictured in the sunny walks of fancys Eden by the romantic and young a queen of beauty unadorned save by her own transcendent loveliness. So soft was her step it failed to make even a sound and but for the magical thrill imparted by her genial touch as other unobtrusive beauties she would have glided away unperceived unsought. A strange sadness rested upon her features like icy tears upon the robe of December as she pointed to the contending elements without and bade me contemplate the two beings presented.This nightmare occupied some ten pages of manuscript and wound up witha sermon so destructive of all hope to nonPresbyterians that it tookthe first prize. This composition was considered to be the very finesteffort of the evening. The mayor of the village in delivering theprize to the author of it made a warm speech in which he said that itwas by far the most eloquent thing he had ever listened to and thatDaniel Webster himself might well be proud of it.It may be remarked in passing that the number of compositions inwhich the word beauteous was overfondled and human experiencereferred to as lifes page was up to the usual average.Now the master mellow almost to the verge of geniality put his chairaside turned his back to the audience and began to draw a map ofAmerica on the blackboard to exercise the geography class upon. But hemade a sad business of it with his unsteady hand and a smotheredtitter rippled over the house. He knew what the matter was and sethimself to right it. He sponged out lines and remade them but he onlydistorted them more than ever and the tittering was more pronounced.He threw his entire attention upon his work now as if determined notto be put down by the mirth. He felt that all eyes were fastened uponhim he imagined he was succeeding and yet the tittering continued iteven manifestly increased. And well it might. There was a garret abovepierced with a scuttle over his head and down through this scuttlecame a cat suspended around the haunches by a string she had a ragtied about her head and jaws to keep her from mewing as she slowlydescended she curved upward and clawed at the string she swungdownward and clawed at the intangible air. The tittering rose higherand higher the cat was within six inches of the absorbed teachershead down down a little lower and she grabbed his wig with herdesperate claws clung to it and was snatched up into the garret in aninstant with her trophy still in her possession And how the light didblaze abroad from the masters bald pate for the signpainters boyhad GILDED itThat broke up the meeting. The boys were avenged. Vacation had come. NOTE The pretended compositions quoted in this chapter are taken without alteration from a volume entitled Prose and Poetry by a Western Lady but they are exactly and precisely after the schoolgirl pattern and hence are much happier than any mere imitations could be.CHAPTER XXIITOM joined the new order of Cadets of Temperance being attracted bythe showy character of their regalia. He promised to abstain fromsmoking chewing and profanity as long as he remained a member. Now hefound out a new thing namely that to promise not to do a thing is thesurest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that verything. Tom soon found himself tormented with a desire to drink andswear the desire grew to be so intense that nothing but the hope of achance to display himself in his red sash kept him from withdrawingfrom the order. Fourth of July was coming but he soon gave that up gave it up before he had worn his shackles over fortyeight hours andfixed his hopes upon old Judge Frazer justice of the peace who wasapparently on his deathbed and would have a big public funeral sincehe was so high an official. During three days Tom was deeply concernedabout the Judges condition and hungry for news of it. Sometimes hishopes ran high so high that he would venture to get out his regaliaand practise before the lookingglass. But the Judge had a mostdiscouraging way of fluctuating. At last he was pronounced upon themend and then convalescent. Tom was disgusted and felt a sense ofinjury too. He handed in his resignation at once and that night theJudge suffered a relapse and died. Tom resolved that he would nevertrust a man like that again.The funeral was a fine thing. The Cadets paraded in a style calculatedto kill the late member with envy. Tom was a free boy again however there was something in that. He could drink and swear now but foundto his surprise that he did not want to. The simple fact that he couldtook the desire away and the charm of it.Tom presently wondered to find that his coveted vacation was beginningto hang a little heavily on his hands.He attempted a diary but nothing happened during three days and sohe abandoned it.The first of all the negro minstrel shows came to town and made asensation. Tom and Joe Harper got up a band of performers and werehappy for two days.Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure for it rainedhard there was no procession in consequence and the greatest man inthe world as Tom supposed Mr. Benton an actual United StatesSenator proved an overwhelming disappointment for he was nottwentyfive feet high nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.A circus came. The boys played circus for three days afterward intents made of rag carpeting admission three pins for boys two forgirls and then circusing was abandoned.A phrenologist and a mesmerizer came and went again and left thevillage duller and drearier than ever.There were some boysandgirls parties but they were so few and sodelightful that they only made the aching voids between ache the harder.Becky Thatcher was gone to her Constantinople home to stay with herparents during vacation so there was no bright side to life anywhere.The dreadful secret of the murder was a chronic misery. It was a verycancer for permanency and pain.Then came the measles.During two long weeks Tom lay a prisoner dead to the world and itshappenings. He was very ill he was interested in nothing. When he gotupon his feet at last and moved feebly downtown a melancholy changehad come over everything and every creature. There had been arevival and everybody had got religion not only the adults buteven the boys and girls. Tom went about hoping against hope for thesight of one blessed sinful face but disappointment crossed himeverywhere. He found Joe Harper studying a Testament and turned sadlyaway from the depressing spectacle. He sought Ben Rogers and found himvisiting the poor with a basket of tracts. He hunted up Jim Hollis whocalled his attention to the precious blessing of his late measles as awarning. Every boy he encountered added another ton to his depressionand when in desperation he flew for refuge at last to the bosom ofHuckleberry Finn and was received with a Scriptural quotation hisheart broke and he crept home and to bed realizing that he alone of allthe town was lost forever and forever.And that night there came on a terrific storm with driving rainawful claps of thunder and blinding sheets of lightning. He covered hishead with the bedclothes and waited in a horror of suspense for hisdoom for he had not the shadow of a doubt that all this hubbub wasabout him. He believed he had taxed the forbearance of the powers aboveto the extremity of endurance and that this was the result. It mighthave seemed to him a waste of pomp and ammunition to kill a bug with abattery of artillery but there seemed nothing incongruous about thegetting up such an expensive thunderstorm as this to knock the turffrom under an insect like himself.By and by the tempest spent itself and died without accomplishing itsobject. The boys first impulse was to be grateful and reform. Hissecond was to wait for there might not be any more storms.The next day the doctors were back Tom had relapsed. The three weekshe spent on his back this time seemed an entire age. When he got abroadat last he was hardly grateful that he had been spared remembering howlonely was his estate how companionless and forlorn he was. He driftedlistlessly down the street and found Jim Hollis acting as judge in ajuvenile court that was trying a cat for murder in the presence of hervictim a bird. He found Joe Harper and Huck Finn up an alley eating astolen melon. Poor lads they like Tom had suffered a relapse.CHAPTER XXIIIAT last the sleepy atmosphere was stirred and vigorously the murdertrial came on in the court. It became the absorbing topic of villagetalk immediately. Tom could not get away from it. Every reference tothe murder sent a shudder to his heart for his troubled conscience andfears almost persuaded him that these remarks were put forth in hishearing as feelers he did not see how he could be suspected ofknowing anything about the murder but still he could not becomfortable in the midst of this gossip. It kept him in a cold shiverall the time. He took Huck to a lonely place to have a talk with him.It would be some relief to unseal his tongue for a little while todivide his burden of distress with another sufferer. Moreover hewanted to assure himself that Huck had remained discreet.Huck have you ever told anybody about thatBout whatYou know what.Oh course I havent.Never a wordNever a solitary word so help me. What makes you askWell I was afeard.Why Tom Sawyer we wouldnt be alive two days if that got found out.YOU know that.Tom felt more comfortable. After a pauseHuck they couldnt anybody get you to tell could theyGet me to tell Why if I wanted that halfbreed devil to drownd methey could get me to tell. They aint no different way.Well thats all right then. I reckon were safe as long as we keepmum. But lets swear again anyway. Its more surer.Im agreed.So they swore again with dread solemnities.What is the talk around Huck Ive heard a power of it.Talk Well its just Muff Potter Muff Potter Muff Potter all thetime. It keeps me in a sweat constant sos I want to hide somers.Thats just the same way they go on round me. I reckon hes a goner.Dont you feel sorry for him sometimesMost always most always. He aint no account but then he haintever done anything to hurt anybody. Just fishes a little to get moneyto get drunk on and loafs around considerable but lord we all dothat leastways most of us preachers and such like. But hes kind ofgood he give me half a fish once when there warnt enough for twoand lots of times hes kind of stood by me when I was out of luck.Well hes mended kites for me Huck and knitted hooks on to myline. I wish we could get him out of there.My we couldnt get him out Tom. And besides twouldnt do anygood theyd ketch him again.Yes so they would. But I hate to hear em abuse him so like thedickens when he never done that.I do too Tom. Lord I hear em say hes the bloodiest lookingvillain in this country and they wonder he wasnt ever hung before.Yes they talk like that all the time. Ive heard em say that if hewas to get free theyd lynch him.And theyd do it too.The boys had a long talk but it brought them little comfort. As thetwilight drew on they found themselves hanging about the neighborhoodof the little isolated jail perhaps with an undefined hope thatsomething would happen that might clear away their difficulties. Butnothing happened there seemed to be no angels or fairies interested inthis luckless captive.The boys did as they had often done before went to the cell gratingand gave Potter some tobacco and matches. He was on the ground floorand there were no guards.His gratitude for their gifts had always smote their consciencesbefore it cut deeper than ever this time. They felt cowardly andtreacherous to the last degree when Potter saidYouve been mighty good to me boys bettern anybody else in thistown. And I dont forget it I dont. Often I says to myself says II used to mend all the boys kites and things and show em where thegood fishin places was and befriend em what I could and now theyveall forgot old Muff when hes in trouble but Tom dont and Huckdont THEY dont forget him says I and I dont forget them. Wellboys I done an awful thing drunk and crazy at the time thats theonly way I account for it and now I got to swing for it and itsright. Right and BEST too I reckon hope so anyway. Well we wonttalk about that. I dont want to make YOU feel bad youve befriendedme. But what I want to say is dont YOU ever get drunk then you wontever get here. Stand a litter furder west so thats it its a primecomfort to see faces thats friendly when a bodys in such a muck oftrouble and there dont none come here but yourn. Good friendlyfaces good friendly faces. Git up on one anothers backs and let metouch em. Thats it. Shake hands yournll come through the bars butmines too big. Little hands and weak but theyve helped Muff Pottera power and theyd help him more if they could.Tom went home miserable and his dreams that night were full ofhorrors. The next day and the day after he hung about the courtroomdrawn by an almost irresistible impulse to go in but forcing himselfto stay out. Huck was having the same experience. They studiouslyavoided each other. Each wandered away from time to time but the samedismal fascination always brought them back presently. Tom kept hisears open when idlers sauntered out of the courtroom but invariablyheard distressing news the toils were closing more and morerelentlessly around poor Potter. At the end of the second day thevillage talk was to the effect that Injun Joes evidence stood firm andunshaken and that there was not the slightest question as to what thejurys verdict would be.Tom was out late that night and came to bed through the window. Hewas in a tremendous state of excitement. It was hours before he got tosleep. All the village flocked to the courthouse the next morning forthis was to be the great day. Both sexes were about equally representedin the packed audience. After a long wait the jury filed in and tooktheir places shortly afterward Potter pale and haggard timid andhopeless was brought in with chains upon him and seated where allthe curious eyes could stare at him no less conspicuous was Injun Joestolid as ever. There was another pause and then the judge arrived andthe sheriff proclaimed the opening of the court. The usual whisperingsamong the lawyers and gathering together of papers followed. Thesedetails and accompanying delays worked up an atmosphere of preparationthat was as impressive as it was fascinating.Now a witness was called who testified that he found Muff Potterwashing in the brook at an early hour of the morning that the murderwas discovered and that he immediately sneaked away. After somefurther questioning counsel for the prosecution saidTake the witness.The prisoner raised his eyes for a moment but dropped them again whenhis own counsel saidI have no questions to ask him.The next witness proved the finding of the knife near the corpse.Counsel for the prosecution saidTake the witness.I have no questions to ask him Potters lawyer replied.A third witness swore he had often seen the knife in Potterspossession.Take the witness.Counsel for Potter declined to question him. The faces of the audiencebegan to betray annoyance. Did this attorney mean to throw away hisclients life without an effortSeveral witnesses deposed concerning Potters guilty behavior whenbrought to the scene of the murder. They were allowed to leave thestand without being crossquestioned.Every detail of the damaging circumstances that occurred in thegraveyard upon that morning which all present remembered so well wasbrought out by credible witnesses but none of them were crossexaminedby Potters lawyer. The perplexity and dissatisfaction of the houseexpressed itself in murmurs and provoked a reproof from the bench.Counsel for the prosecution now saidBy the oaths of citizens whose simple word is above suspicion wehave fastened this awful crime beyond all possibility of questionupon the unhappy prisoner at the bar. We rest our case here.A groan escaped from poor Potter and he put his face in his hands androcked his body softly to and fro while a painful silence reigned inthe courtroom. Many men were moved and many womens compassiontestified itself in tears. Counsel for the defence rose and saidYour honor in our remarks at the opening of this trial weforeshadowed our purpose to prove that our client did this fearful deedwhile under the influence of a blind and irresponsible deliriumproduced by drink. We have changed our mind. We shall not offer thatplea. Then to the clerk Call Thomas SawyerA puzzled amazement awoke in every face in the house not evenexcepting Potters. Every eye fastened itself with wondering interestupon Tom as he rose and took his place upon the stand. The boy lookedwild enough for he was badly scared. The oath was administered.Thomas Sawyer where were you on the seventeenth of June about thehour of midnightTom glanced at Injun Joes iron face and his tongue failed him. Theaudience listened breathless but the words refused to come. After afew moments however the boy got a little of his strength back andmanaged to put enough of it into his voice to make part of the househearIn the graveyardA little bit louder please. Dont be afraid. You were In the graveyard.A contemptuous smile flitted across Injun Joes face.Were you anywhere near Horse Williams graveYes sir.Speak up just a trifle louder. How near were youNear as I am to you.Were you hidden or notI was hid.WhereBehind the elms thats on the edge of the grave.Injun Joe gave a barely perceptible start.Any one with youYes sir. I went there with Wait wait a moment. Never mind mentioning your companions name. Wewill produce him at the proper time. Did you carry anything there withyou.Tom hesitated and looked confused.Speak out my boy dont be diffident. The truth is alwaysrespectable. What did you take thereOnly a a dead cat.There was a ripple of mirth which the court checked.We will produce the skeleton of that cat. Now my boy tell useverything that occurred tell it in your own way dont skip anythingand dont be afraid.Tom began hesitatingly at first but as he warmed to his subject hiswords flowed more and more easily in a little while every sound ceasedbut his own voice every eye fixed itself upon him with parted lipsand bated breath the audience hung upon his words taking no note oftime rapt in the ghastly fascinations of the tale. The strain uponpent emotion reached its climax when the boy said and as the doctor fetched the board around and Muff Potter fellInjun Joe jumped with the knife and Crash Quick as lightning the halfbreed sprang for a window tore hisway through all opposers and was goneCHAPTER XXIVTOM was a glittering hero once more the pet of the old the envy ofthe young. His name even went into immortal print for the villagepaper magnified him. There were some that believed he would bePresident yet if he escaped hanging.As usual the fickle unreasoning world took Muff Potter to its bosomand fondled him as lavishly as it had abused him before. But that sortof conduct is to the worlds credit therefore it is not well to findfault with it.Toms days were days of splendor and exultation to him but his nightswere seasons of horror. Injun Joe infested all his dreams and alwayswith doom in his eye. Hardly any temptation could persuade the boy tostir abroad after nightfall. Poor Huck was in the same state ofwretchedness and terror for Tom had told the whole story to the lawyerthe night before the great day of the trial and Huck was sore afraidthat his share in the business might leak out yet notwithstandingInjun Joes flight had saved him the suffering of testifying in court.The poor fellow had got the attorney to promise secrecy but what ofthat Since Toms harassed conscience had managed to drive him to thelawyers house by night and wring a dread tale from lips that had beensealed with the dismalest and most formidable of oaths Hucksconfidence in the human race was wellnigh obliterated.Daily Muff Potters gratitude made Tom glad he had spoken but nightlyhe wished he had sealed up his tongue.Half the time Tom was afraid Injun Joe would never be captured theother half he was afraid he would be. He felt sure he never could drawa safe breath again until that man was dead and he had seen the corpse.Rewards had been offered the country had been scoured but no InjunJoe was found. One of those omniscient and aweinspiring marvels adetective came up from St. Louis moused around shook his headlooked wise and made that sort of astounding success which members ofthat craft usually achieve. That is to say he found a clew. But youcant hang a clew for murder and so after that detective had gotthrough and gone home Tom felt just as insecure as he was before.The slow days drifted on and each left behind it a slightly lightenedweight of apprehension.CHAPTER XXVTHERE comes a time in every rightlyconstructed boys life when he hasa raging desire to go somewhere and dig for hidden treasure. Thisdesire suddenly came upon Tom one day. He sallied out to find JoeHarper but failed of success. Next he sought Ben Rogers he had gonefishing. Presently he stumbled upon Huck Finn the RedHanded. Huckwould answer. Tom took him to a private place and opened the matter tohim confidentially. Huck was willing. Huck was always willing to take ahand in any enterprise that offered entertainment and required nocapital for he had a troublesome superabundance of that sort of timewhich is not money. Wherell we dig said Huck.Oh most anywhere.Why is it hid all aroundNo indeed it aint. Its hid in mighty particular places Huck sometimes on islands sometimes in rotten chests under the end of alimb of an old dead tree just where the shadow falls at midnight butmostly under the floor in hanted houses.Who hides itWhy robbers of course whod you reckon SundayschoolsuprintendentsI dont know. If twas mine I wouldnt hide it Id spend it and havea good time.So would I. But robbers dont do that way. They always hide it andleave it there.Dont they come after it any moreNo they think they will but they generally forget the marks orelse they die. Anyway it lays there a long time and gets rusty and byand by somebody finds an old yellow paper that tells how to find themarks a paper thats got to be ciphered over about a week because itsmostly signs and hyroglyphics.Hyro whichHyroglyphics pictures and things you know that dont seem to meananything.Have you got one of them papers TomNo.Well then how you going to find the marksI dont want any marks. They always bury it under a hanted house oron an island or under a dead tree thats got one limb sticking out.Well weve tried Jacksons Island a little and we can try it againsome time and theres the old hanted house up the StillHouse branchand theres lots of deadlimb trees dead loads of em.Is it under all of themHow you talk NoThen how you going to know which one to go forGo for all of emWhy Tom itll take all summer.Well what of that Suppose you find a brass pot with a hundreddollars in it all rusty and gray or rotten chest full of dimonds.Hows thatHucks eyes glowed.Thats bully. Plenty bully enough for me. Just you gimme the hundreddollars and I dont want no dimonds.All right. But I bet you I aint going to throw off on dimonds. Someof ems worth twenty dollars apiece there aint any hardly butsworth six bits or a dollar.No Is that soCertnly anybodyll tell you so. Haint you ever seen one HuckNot as I remember.Oh kings have slathers of them.Well I don know no kings Tom.I reckon you dont. But if you was to go to Europe youd see a raftof em hopping around.Do they hopHop your granny NoWell what did you say they did forShucks I only meant youd SEE em not hopping of course what dothey want to hop for but I mean youd just see em scattered aroundyou know in a kind of a general way. Like that old humpbacked Richard.Richard Whats his other nameHe didnt have any other name. Kings dont have any but a given name.NoBut they dont.Well if they like it Tom all right but I dont want to be a kingand have only just a given name like a nigger. But say where yougoing to dig firstWell I dont know. Spose we tackle that old deadlimb tree on thehill tother side of StillHouse branchIm agreed.So they got a crippled pick and a shovel and set out on theirthreemile tramp. They arrived hot and panting and threw themselvesdown in the shade of a neighboring elm to rest and have a smoke.I like this said Tom.So do I.Say Huck if we find a treasure here what you going to do with yourshareWell Ill have pie and a glass of soda every day and Ill go toevery circus that comes along. I bet Ill have a gay time.Well aint you going to save any of itSave it What forWhy so as to have something to live on by and by.Oh that aint any use. Pap would come back to thishyer town someday and get his claws on it if I didnt hurry up and I tell you hedclean it out pretty quick. What you going to do with yourn TomIm going to buy a new drum and a surenough sword and a rednecktie and a bull pup and get married.MarriedThats it.Tom you why you aint in your right mind.Wait youll see.Well thats the foolishest thing you could do. Look at pap and mymother. Fight Why they used to fight all the time. I remember mightywell.That aint anything. The girl Im going to marry wont fight.Tom I reckon theyre all alike. Theyll all comb a body. Now youbetter think bout this awhile. I tell you you better. Whats the nameof the galIt aint a gal at all its a girl.Its all the same I reckon some says gal some says girl bothsright like enough. Anyway whats her name TomIll tell you some time not now.All right thatll do. Only if you get married Ill be more lonesomerthan ever.No you wont. Youll come and live with me. Now stir out of this andwell go to digging.They worked and sweated for half an hour. No result. They toiledanother halfhour. Still no result. Huck saidDo they always bury it as deep as thisSometimes not always. Not generally. I reckon we havent got theright place.So they chose a new spot and began again. The labor dragged a littlebut still they made progress. They pegged away in silence for sometime. Finally Huck leaned on his shovel swabbed the beaded drops fromhis brow with his sleeve and saidWhere you going to dig next after we get this oneI reckon maybe well tackle the old tree thats over yonder onCardiff Hill back of the widows.I reckon thatll be a good one. But wont the widow take it away fromus Tom Its on her land.SHE take it away Maybe shed like to try it once. Whoever finds oneof these hid treasures it belongs to him. It dont make any differencewhose land its on.That was satisfactory. The work went on. By and by Huck saidBlame it we must be in the wrong place again. What do you thinkIt is mighty curious Huck. I dont understand it. Sometimes witchesinterfere. I reckon maybe thats whats the trouble now.Shucks Witches aint got no power in the daytime.Well thats so. I didnt think of that. Oh I know what the matteris What a blamed lot of fools we are You got to find out where theshadow of the limb falls at midnight and thats where you digThen consound it weve fooled away all this work for nothing. Nowhang it all we got to come back in the night. Its an awful long way.Can you get outI bet I will. Weve got to do it tonight too because if somebodysees these holes theyll know in a minute whats here and theyll gofor it.Well Ill come around and maow tonight.All right. Lets hide the tools in the bushes.The boys were there that night about the appointed time. They sat inthe shadow waiting. It was a lonely place and an hour made solemn byold traditions. Spirits whispered in the rustling leaves ghosts lurkedin the murky nooks the deep baying of a hound floated up out of thedistance an owl answered with his sepulchral note. The boys weresubdued by these solemnities and talked little. By and by they judgedthat twelve had come they marked where the shadow fell and began todig. Their hopes commenced to rise. Their interest grew stronger andtheir industry kept pace with it. The hole deepened and still deepenedbut every time their hearts jumped to hear the pick strike uponsomething they only suffered a new disappointment. It was only a stoneor a chunk. At last Tom saidIt aint any use Huck were wrong again.Well but we CANT be wrong. We spotted the shadder to a dot.I know it but then theres another thing.Whats that.Why we only guessed at the time. Like enough it was too late or tooearly.Huck dropped his shovel.Thats it said he. Thats the very trouble. We got to give thisone up. We cant ever tell the right time and besides this kind ofthings too awful here this time of night with witches and ghostsafluttering around so. I feel as if somethings behind me all the timeand Im afeard to turn around becuz maybe theres others in frontawaiting for a chance. I been creeping all over ever since I got here.Well Ive been pretty much so too Huck. They most always put in adead man when they bury a treasure under a tree to look out for it.LordyYes they do. Ive always heard that.Tom I dont like to fool around much where theres dead people. Abodys bound to get into trouble with em sure.I dont like to stir em up either. Spose this one here was tostick his skull out and say somethingDont Tom Its awful.Well it just is. Huck I dont feel comfortable a bit.Say Tom lets give this place up and try somewheres else.All right I reckon we better.Whatll it beTom considered awhile and then saidThe hanted house. Thats itBlame it I dont like hanted houses Tom. Why theyre a dern sightworsen dead people. Dead people might talk maybe but they dont comesliding around in a shroud when you aint noticing and peep over yourshoulder all of a sudden and grit their teeth the way a ghost does. Icouldnt stand such a thing as that Tom nobody could.Yes but Huck ghosts dont travel around only at night. They wonthender us from digging there in the daytime.Well thats so. But you know mighty well people dont go about thathanted house in the day nor the night.Well thats mostly because they dont like to go where a mans beenmurdered anyway but nothings ever been seen around that house exceptin the night just some blue lights slipping by the windows no regularghosts.Well where you see one of them blue lights flickering around Tomyou can bet theres a ghost mighty close behind it. It stands toreason. Becuz you know that they dont anybody but ghosts use em.Yes thats so. But anyway they dont come around in the daytime sowhats the use of our being afeardWell all right. Well tackle the hanted house if you say so but Ireckon its taking chances.They had started down the hill by this time. There in the middle ofthe moonlit valley below them stood the hanted house utterlyisolated its fences gone long ago rank weeds smothering the verydoorsteps the chimney crumbled to ruin the windowsashes vacant acorner of the roof caved in. The boys gazed awhile half expecting tosee a blue light flit past a window then talking in a low tone asbefitted the time and the circumstances they struck far off to theright to give the haunted house a wide berth and took their wayhomeward through the woods that adorned the rearward side of CardiffHill.CHAPTER XXVIABOUT noon the next day the boys arrived at the dead tree they hadcome for their tools. Tom was impatient to go to the haunted houseHuck was measurably so also but suddenly saidLookyhere Tom do you know what day it isTom mentally ran over the days of the week and then quickly liftedhis eyes with a startled look in them My I never once thought of it HuckWell I didnt neither but all at once it popped onto me that it wasFriday.Blame it a body cant be too careful Huck. We might a got into anawful scrape tackling such a thing on a Friday.MIGHT Better say we WOULD Theres some lucky days maybe butFriday aint.Any fool knows that. I dont reckon YOU was the first that found itout Huck.Well I never said I was did I And Friday aint all neither. I hada rotten bad dream last night dreampt about rats.No Sure sign of trouble. Did they fightNo.Well thats good Huck. When they dont fight its only a sign thattheres trouble around you know. All we got to do is to look mightysharp and keep out of it. Well drop this thing for today and play.Do you know Robin Hood HuckNo. Whos Robin HoodWhy he was one of the greatest men that was ever in England and thebest. He was a robber.Cracky I wisht I was. Who did he robOnly sheriffs and bishops and rich people and kings and such like.But he never bothered the poor. He loved em. He always divided up withem perfectly square.Well he must a been a brick.I bet you he was Huck. Oh he was the noblest man that ever was.They aint any such men now I can tell you. He could lick any man inEngland with one hand tied behind him and he could take his yew bowand plug a tencent piece every time a mile and a half.Whats a YEW bowI dont know. Its some kind of a bow of course. And if he hit thatdime only on the edge he would set down and cry and curse. But wellplay Robin Hood its nobby fun. Ill learn you.Im agreed.So they played Robin Hood all the afternoon now and then casting ayearning eye down upon the haunted house and passing a remark about themorrows prospects and possibilities there. As the sun began to sinkinto the west they took their way homeward athwart the long shadows ofthe trees and soon were buried from sight in the forests of CardiffHill.On Saturday shortly after noon the boys were at the dead tree again.They had a smoke and a chat in the shade and then dug a little intheir last hole not with great hope but merely because Tom said therewere so many cases where people had given up a treasure after gettingdown within six inches of it and then somebody else had come along andturned it up with a single thrust of a shovel. The thing failed thistime however so the boys shouldered their tools and went away feelingthat they had not trifled with fortune but had fulfilled all therequirements that belong to the business of treasurehunting.When they reached the haunted house there was something so weird andgrisly about the dead silence that reigned there under the baking sunand something so depressing about the loneliness and desolation of theplace that they were afraid for a moment to venture in. Then theycrept to the door and took a trembling peep. They saw a weedgrownfloorless room unplastered an ancient fireplace vacant windows aruinous staircase and here there and everywhere hung ragged andabandoned cobwebs. They presently entered softly with quickenedpulses talking in whispers ears alert to catch the slightest soundand muscles tense and ready for instant retreat.In a little while familiarity modified their fears and they gave theplace a critical and interested examination rather admiring their ownboldness and wondering at it too. Next they wanted to look upstairs.This was something like cutting off retreat but they got to daringeach other and of course there could be but one result they threwtheir tools into a corner and made the ascent. Up there were the samesigns of decay. In one corner they found a closet that promisedmystery but the promise was a fraud there was nothing in it. Theircourage was up now and well in hand. They were about to go down andbegin work when Sh said Tom.What is it whispered Huck blanching with fright.Sh... There... Hear itYes... Oh my Lets runKeep still Dont you budge Theyre coming right toward the door.The boys stretched themselves upon the floor with their eyes toknotholes in the planking and lay waiting in a misery of fear.Theyve stopped.... No coming.... Here they are. Dont whisperanother word Huck. My goodness I wish I was out of thisTwo men entered. Each boy said to himself Theres the old deaf anddumb Spaniard thats been about town once or twice lately never sawtother man before.Tother was a ragged unkempt creature with nothing very pleasantin his face. The Spaniard was wrapped in a serape he had bushy whitewhiskers long white hair flowed from under his sombrero and he woregreen goggles. When they came in tother was talking in a low voicethey sat down on the ground facing the door with their backs to thewall and the speaker continued his remarks. His manner became lessguarded and his words more distinct as he proceededNo said he Ive thought it all over and I dont like it. Itsdangerous.Dangerous grunted the deaf and dumb Spaniard to the vastsurprise of the boys. MilksopThis voice made the boys gasp and quake. It was Injun Joes There wassilence for some time. Then Joe saidWhats any more dangerous than that job up yonder but nothings comeof it.Thats different. Away up the river so and not another house about.Twont ever be known that we tried anyway long as we didnt succeed.Well whats more dangerous than coming here in the daytime anybodywould suspicion us that saw us.I know that. But there warnt any other place as handy after thatfool of a job. I want to quit this shanty. I wanted to yesterday onlyit warnt any use trying to stir out of here with those infernal boysplaying over there on the hill right in full view.Those infernal boys quaked again under the inspiration of thisremark and thought how lucky it was that they had remembered it wasFriday and concluded to wait a day. They wished in their hearts theyhad waited a year.The two men got out some food and made a luncheon. After a long andthoughtful silence Injun Joe saidLook here lad you go back up the river where you belong. Wait theretill you hear from me. Ill take the chances on dropping into this townjust once more for a look. Well do that dangerous job after Ivespied around a little and think things look well for it. Then forTexas Well leg it togetherThis was satisfactory. Both men presently fell to yawning and InjunJoe saidIm dead for sleep Its your turn to watch.He curled down in the weeds and soon began to snore. His comradestirred him once or twice and he became quiet. Presently the watcherbegan to nod his head drooped lower and lower both men began to snorenow.The boys drew a long grateful breath. Tom whisperedNows our chance comeHuck saidI cant Id die if they was to wake.Tom urged Huck held back. At last Tom rose slowly and softly andstarted alone. But the first step he made wrung such a hideous creakfrom the crazy floor that he sank down almost dead with fright. Henever made a second attempt. The boys lay there counting the draggingmoments till it seemed to them that time must be done and eternitygrowing gray and then they were grateful to note that at last the sunwas setting.Now one snore ceased. Injun Joe sat up stared around smiled grimlyupon his comrade whose head was drooping upon his knees stirred himup with his foot and saidHere YOURE a watchman aint you All right though nothingshappened.My have I been asleepOh partly partly. Nearly time for us to be moving pard. Whatll wedo with what little swag weve got leftI dont know leave it here as weve always done I reckon. No use totake it away till we start south. Six hundred and fifty in silverssomething to carry.Well all right it wont matter to come here once more.No but Id say come in the night as we used to do its better.Yes but look here it may be a good while before I get the rightchance at that job accidents might happen taint in such a very goodplace well just regularly bury it and bury it deep.Good idea said the comrade who walked across the room knelt downraised one of the rearward hearthstones and took out a bag thatjingled pleasantly. He subtracted from it twenty or thirty dollars forhimself and as much for Injun Joe and passed the bag to the latterwho was on his knees in the corner now digging with his bowieknife.The boys forgot all their fears all their miseries in an instant.With gloating eyes they watched every movement. Luck the splendor ofit was beyond all imagination Six hundred dollars was money enough tomake half a dozen boys rich Here was treasurehunting under thehappiest auspices there would not be any bothersome uncertainty as towhere to dig. They nudged each other every moment eloquent nudges andeasily understood for they simply meant Oh but aint you glad NOWwere hereJoes knife struck upon something.Hello said he.What is it said his comrade.Halfrotten plank no its a box I believe. Here bear a hand andwell see what its here for. Never mind Ive broke a hole.He reached his hand in and drew it out Man its moneyThe two men examined the handful of coins. They were gold. The boysabove were as excited as themselves and as delighted.Joes comrade saidWell make quick work of this. Theres an old rusty pick over amongstthe weeds in the corner the other side of the fireplace I saw it aminute ago.He ran and brought the boys pick and shovel. Injun Joe took the picklooked it over critically shook his head muttered something tohimself and then began to use it. The box was soon unearthed. It wasnot very large it was iron bound and had been very strong before theslow years had injured it. The men contemplated the treasure awhile inblissful silence.Pard theres thousands of dollars here said Injun Joe.Twas always said that Murrels gang used to be around here onesummer the stranger observed.I know it said Injun Joe and this looks like it I should say.Now you wont need to do that job.The halfbreed frowned. Said heYou dont know me. Least you dont know all about that thing. Taintrobbery altogether its REVENGE and a wicked light flamed in hiseyes. Ill need your help in it. When its finished then Texas. Gohome to your Nance and your kids and stand by till you hear from me.Well if you say so whatll we do with this bury it againYes. Ravishing delight overhead. NO by the great Sachem noProfound distress overhead. Id nearly forgot. That pick had freshearth on it The boys were sick with terror in a moment. Whatbusiness has a pick and a shovel here What business with fresh earthon them Who brought them here and where are they gone Have you heardanybody seen anybody What bury it again and leave them to come andsee the ground disturbed Not exactly not exactly. Well take it to myden.Why of course Might have thought of that before. You mean NumberOneNo Number Two under the cross. The other place is bad too common.All right. Its nearly dark enough to start.Injun Joe got up and went about from window to window cautiouslypeeping out. Presently he saidWho could have brought those tools here Do you reckon they can beupstairsThe boys breath forsook them. Injun Joe put his hand on his knifehalted a moment undecided and then turned toward the stairway. Theboys thought of the closet but their strength was gone. The steps camecreaking up the stairs the intolerable distress of the situation wokethe stricken resolution of the lads they were about to spring for thecloset when there was a crash of rotten timbers and Injun Joe landedon the ground amid the debris of the ruined stairway. He gatheredhimself up cursing and his comrade saidNow whats the use of all that If its anybody and theyre upthere let them STAY there who cares If they want to jump down nowand get into trouble who objects It will be dark in fifteen minutes and then let them follow us if they want to. Im willing. In myopinion whoever hove those things in here caught a sight of us andtook us for ghosts or devils or something. Ill bet theyre runningyet.Joe grumbled awhile then he agreed with his friend that what daylightwas left ought to be economized in getting things ready for leaving.Shortly afterward they slipped out of the house in the deepeningtwilight and moved toward the river with their precious box.Tom and Huck rose up weak but vastly relieved and stared after themthrough the chinks between the logs of the house. Follow Not they.They were content to reach ground again without broken necks and takethe townward track over the hill. They did not talk much. They were toomuch absorbed in hating themselves hating the ill luck that made themtake the spade and the pick there. But for that Injun Joe never wouldhave suspected. He would have hidden the silver with the gold to waitthere till his revenge was satisfied and then he would have had themisfortune to find that money turn up missing. Bitter bitter luck thatthe tools were ever brought thereThey resolved to keep a lookout for that Spaniard when he should cometo town spying out for chances to do his revengeful job and follow himto Number Two wherever that might be. Then a ghastly thoughtoccurred to Tom.Revenge What if he means US HuckOh dont said Huck nearly fainting.They talked it all over and as they entered town they agreed tobelieve that he might possibly mean somebody else at least that hemight at least mean nobody but Tom since only Tom had testified.Very very small comfort it was to Tom to be alone in danger Companywould be a palpable improvement he thought.CHAPTER XXVIITHE adventure of the day mightily tormented Toms dreams that night.Four times he had his hands on that rich treasure and four times itwasted to nothingness in his fingers as sleep forsook him andwakefulness brought back the hard reality of his misfortune. As he layin the early morning recalling the incidents of his great adventure henoticed that they seemed curiously subdued and far away somewhat as ifthey had happened in another world or in a time long gone by. Then itoccurred to him that the great adventure itself must be a dream Therewas one very strong argument in favor of this idea namely that thequantity of coin he had seen was too vast to be real. He had never seenas much as fifty dollars in one mass before and he was like all boysof his age and station in life in that he imagined that all referencesto hundreds and thousands were mere fanciful forms of speech andthat no such sums really existed in the world. He never had supposedfor a moment that so large a sum as a hundred dollars was to be foundin actual money in any ones possession. If his notions of hiddentreasure had been analyzed they would have been found to consist of ahandful of real dimes and a bushel of vague splendid ungraspabledollars.But the incidents of his adventure grew sensibly sharper and clearerunder the attrition of thinking them over and so he presently foundhimself leaning to the impression that the thing might not have been adream after all. This uncertainty must be swept away. He would snatcha hurried breakfast and go and find Huck. Huck was sitting on thegunwale of a flatboat listlessly dangling his feet in the water andlooking very melancholy. Tom concluded to let Huck lead up to thesubject. If he did not do it then the adventure would be proved tohave been only a dream.Hello HuckHello yourself.Silence for a minute.Tom if wed a left the blame tools at the dead tree wed a gotthe money. Oh aint it awfulTaint a dream then taint a dream Somehow I most wish it was.Dogd if I dont Huck.What aint a dreamOh that thing yesterday. I been half thinking it was.Dream If them stairs hadnt broke down youd a seen how much dreamit was Ive had dreams enough all night with that patcheyed Spanishdevil going for me all through em rot himNo not rot him. FIND him Track the moneyTom well never find him. A feller dont have only one chance forsuch a pile and that ones lost. Id feel mighty shaky if I was to seehim anyway.Well sod I but Id like to see him anyway and track him out tohis Number Two.Number Two yes thats it. I been thinking bout that. But I cantmake nothing out of it. What do you reckon it isI dono. Its too deep. Say Huck maybe its the number of a houseGoody... No Tom that aint it. If it is it aint in thisonehorse town. They aint no numbers here.Well thats so. Lemme think a minute. Here its the number of aroom in a tavern you knowOh thats the trick They aint only two taverns. We can find outquick.You stay here Huck till I come.Tom was off at once. He did not care to have Hucks company in publicplaces. He was gone half an hour. He found that in the best tavern No. had long been occupied by a young lawyer and was still so occupied.In the less ostentatious house No. was a mystery. Thetavernkeepers young son said it was kept locked all the time and henever saw anybody go into it or come out of it except at night he didnot know any particular reason for this state of things had had somelittle curiosity but it was rather feeble had made the most of themystery by entertaining himself with the idea that that room washanted had noticed that there was a light in there the night before.Thats what Ive found out Huck. I reckon thats the very No. were after.I reckon it is Tom. Now what you going to doLemme think.Tom thought a long time. Then he saidIll tell you. The back door of that No. is the door that comes outinto that little close alley between the tavern and the old rattle trapof a brick store. Now you get hold of all the doorkeys you can findand Ill nip all of aunties and the first dark night well go thereand try em. And mind you keep a lookout for Injun Joe because hesaid he was going to drop into town and spy around once more for achance to get his revenge. If you see him you just follow him and ifhe dont go to that No. that aint the place.Lordy I dont want to foller him by myselfWhy itll be night sure. He mightnt ever see you and if he didmaybe hed never think anything.Well if its pretty dark I reckon Ill track him. I dono I dono.Ill try.You bet Ill follow him if its dark Huck. Why he might a foundout he couldnt get his revenge and be going right after that money.Its so Tom its so. Ill foller him I will by jingoesNow youre TALKING Dont you ever weaken Huck and I wont.CHAPTER XXVIIITHAT night Tom and Huck were ready for their adventure. They hungabout the neighborhood of the tavern until after nine one watching thealley at a distance and the other the tavern door. Nobody entered thealley or left it nobody resembling the Spaniard entered or left thetavern door. The night promised to be a fair one so Tom went home withthe understanding that if a considerable degree of darkness came onHuck was to come and maow whereupon he would slip out and try thekeys. But the night remained clear and Huck closed his watch andretired to bed in an empty sugar hogshead about twelve.Tuesday the boys had the same ill luck. Also Wednesday. But Thursdaynight promised better. Tom slipped out in good season with his auntsold tin lantern and a large towel to blindfold it with. He hid thelantern in Hucks sugar hogshead and the watch began. An hour beforemidnight the tavern closed up and its lights the only onesthereabouts were put out. No Spaniard had been seen. Nobody hadentered or left the alley. Everything was auspicious. The blackness ofdarkness reigned the perfect stillness was interrupted only byoccasional mutterings of distant thunder.Tom got his lantern lit it in the hogshead wrapped it closely in thetowel and the two adventurers crept in the gloom toward the tavern.Huck stood sentry and Tom felt his way into the alley. Then there was aseason of waiting anxiety that weighed upon Hucks spirits like amountain. He began to wish he could see a flash from the lantern itwould frighten him but it would at least tell him that Tom was aliveyet. It seemed hours since Tom had disappeared. Surely he must havefainted maybe he was dead maybe his heart had burst under terror andexcitement. In his uneasiness Huck found himself drawing closer andcloser to the alley fearing all sorts of dreadful things andmomentarily expecting some catastrophe to happen that would take awayhis breath. There was not much to take away for he seemed only able toinhale it by thimblefuls and his heart would soon wear itself out theway it was beating. Suddenly there was a flash of light and Tom cametearing by him Run said he run for your lifeHe neednt have repeated it once was enough Huck was making thirtyor forty miles an hour before the repetition was uttered. The boysnever stopped till they reached the shed of a deserted slaughterhouseat the lower end of the village. Just as they got within its shelterthe storm burst and the rain poured down. As soon as Tom got his breathhe saidHuck it was awful I tried two of the keys just as soft as I couldbut they seemed to make such a power of racket that I couldnt hardlyget my breath I was so scared. They wouldnt turn in the lock either.Well without noticing what I was doing I took hold of the knob andopen comes the door It warnt locked I hopped in and shook off thetowel and GREAT CAESARS GHOSTWhat whatd you see TomHuck I most stepped onto Injun Joes handNoYes He was lying there sound asleep on the floor with his oldpatch on his eye and his arms spread out.Lordy what did you do Did he wake upNo never budged. Drunk I reckon. I just grabbed that towel andstartedId never a thought of the towel I betWell I would. My aunt would make me mighty sick if I lost it.Say Tom did you see that boxHuck I didnt wait to look around. I didnt see the box I didntsee the cross. I didnt see anything but a bottle and a tin cup on thefloor by Injun Joe yes I saw two barrels and lots more bottles in theroom. Dont you see now whats the matter with that hanted roomHowWhy its hanted with whiskey Maybe ALL the Temperance Taverns havegot a hanted room hey HuckWell I reckon maybe thats so. Whod a thought such a thing Butsay Tom nows a mighty good time to get that box if Injun Joesdrunk.It is that You try itHuck shuddered.Well no I reckon not.And I reckon not Huck. Only one bottle alongside of Injun Joe aintenough. If thered been three hed be drunk enough and Id do it.There was a long pause for reflection and then Tom saidLookyhere Huck less not try that thing any more till we know InjunJoes not in there. Its too scary. Now if we watch every night wellbe dead sure to see him go out some time or other and then wellsnatch that box quickern lightning.Well Im agreed. Ill watch the whole night long and Ill do itevery night too if youll do the other part of the job.All right I will. All you got to do is to trot up Hooper Street ablock and maow and if Im asleep you throw some gravel at the windowand thatll fetch me.Agreed and good as wheatNow Huck the storms over and Ill go home. Itll begin to bedaylight in a couple of hours. You go back and watch that long willyouI said I would Tom and I will. Ill hant that tavern every nightfor a year Ill sleep all day and Ill stand watch all night.Thats all right. Now where you going to sleepIn Ben Rogers hayloft. He lets me and so does his paps nigger manUncle Jake. I tote water for Uncle Jake whenever he wants me to andany time I ask him he gives me a little something to eat if he canspare it. Thats a mighty good nigger Tom. He likes me becuz I dontever act as if I was above him. Sometime Ive set right down and eatWITH him. But you neednt tell that. A bodys got to do things whenhes awful hungry he wouldnt want to do as a steady thing.Well if I dont want you in the daytime Ill let you sleep. I wontcome bothering around. Any time you see somethings up in the nightjust skip right around and maow.CHAPTER XXIXTHE first thing Tom heard on Friday morning was a glad piece of news Judge Thatchers family had come back to town the night before. BothInjun Joe and the treasure sunk into secondary importance for a momentand Becky took the chief place in the boys interest. He saw her andthey had an exhausting good time playing hispy and gullykeeperwith a crowd of their schoolmates. The day was completed and crownedin a peculiarly satisfactory way Becky teased her mother to appointthe next day for the longpromised and longdelayed picnic and sheconsented. The childs delight was boundless and Toms not moremoderate. The invitations were sent out before sunset and straightwaythe young folks of the village were thrown into a fever of preparationand pleasurable anticipation. Toms excitement enabled him to keepawake until a pretty late hour and he had good hopes of hearing Hucksmaow and of having his treasure to astonish Becky and the picnickerswith next day but he was disappointed. No signal came that night.Morning came eventually and by ten or eleven oclock a giddy androllicking company were gathered at Judge Thatchers and everythingwas ready for a start. It was not the custom for elderly people to marthe picnics with their presence. The children were considered safeenough under the wings of a few young ladies of eighteen and a fewyoung gentlemen of twentythree or thereabouts. The old steam ferryboatwas chartered for the occasion presently the gay throng filed up themain street laden with provisionbaskets. Sid was sick and had to missthe fun Mary remained at home to entertain him. The last thing Mrs.Thatcher said to Becky wasYoull not get back till late. Perhaps youd better stay all nightwith some of the girls that live near the ferrylanding child.Then Ill stay with Susy Harper mamma.Very well. And mind and behave yourself and dont be any trouble.Presently as they tripped along Tom said to BeckySay Ill tell you what well do. Stead of going to Joe Harperswell climb right up the hill and stop at the Widow Douglas. Shellhave icecream She has it most every day dead loads of it. And shellbe awful glad to have us.Oh that will be funThen Becky reflected a moment and saidBut what will mamma sayHowll she ever knowThe girl turned the idea over in her mind and said reluctantlyI reckon its wrong but But shucks Your mother wont know and so whats the harm All shewants is that youll be safe and I bet you shed a said go there ifshed a thought of it. I know she wouldThe Widow Douglas splendid hospitality was a tempting bait. It andToms persuasions presently carried the day. So it was decided to saynothing anybody about the nights programme. Presently it occurred toTom that maybe Huck might come this very night and give the signal. Thethought took a deal of the spirit out of his anticipations. Still hecould not bear to give up the fun at Widow Douglas. And why should hegive it up he reasoned the signal did not come the night before sowhy should it be any more likely to come tonight The sure fun of theevening outweighed the uncertain treasure and boylike he determinedto yield to the stronger inclination and not allow himself to think ofthe box of money another time that day.Three miles below town the ferryboat stopped at the mouth of a woodyhollow and tied up. The crowd swarmed ashore and soon the forestdistances and craggy heights echoed far and near with shoutings andlaughter. All the different ways of getting hot and tired were gonethrough with and byandby the rovers straggled back to camp fortifiedwith responsible appetites and then the destruction of the good thingsbegan. After the feast there was a refreshing season of rest and chatin the shade of spreading oaks. Byandby somebody shoutedWhos ready for the caveEverybody was. Bundles of candles were procured and straightway therewas a general scamper up the hill. The mouth of the cave was up thehillside an opening shaped like a letter A. Its massive oaken doorstood unbarred. Within was a small chamber chilly as an icehouse andwalled by Nature with solid limestone that was dewy with a cold sweat.It was romantic and mysterious to stand here in the deep gloom and lookout upon the green valley shining in the sun. But the impressiveness ofthe situation quickly wore off and the romping began again. The momenta candle was lighted there was a general rush upon the owner of it astruggle and a gallant defence followed but the candle was soonknocked down or blown out and then there was a glad clamor of laughterand a new chase. But all things have an end. Byandby the processionwent filing down the steep descent of the main avenue the flickeringrank of lights dimly revealing the lofty walls of rock almost to theirpoint of junction sixty feet overhead. This main avenue was not morethan eight or ten feet wide. Every few steps other lofty and stillnarrower crevices branched from it on either hand for McDougals cavewas but a vast labyrinth of crooked aisles that ran into each other andout again and led nowhere. It was said that one might wander days andnights together through its intricate tangle of rifts and chasms andnever find the end of the cave and that he might go down and downand still down into the earth and it was just the same labyrinthunder labyrinth and no end to any of them. No man knew the cave.That was an impossible thing. Most of the young men knew a portion ofit and it was not customary to venture much beyond this known portion.Tom Sawyer knew as much of the cave as any one.The procession moved along the main avenue some threequarters of amile and then groups and couples began to slip aside into branchavenues fly along the dismal corridors and take each other bysurprise at points where the corridors joined again. Parties were ableto elude each other for the space of half an hour without going beyondthe known ground.Byandby one group after another came straggling back to the mouthof the cave panting hilarious smeared from head to foot with tallowdrippings daubed with clay and entirely delighted with the success ofthe day. Then they were astonished to find that they had been taking nonote of time and that night was about at hand. The clanging bell hadbeen calling for half an hour. However this sort of close to the daysadventures was romantic and therefore satisfactory. When the ferryboatwith her wild freight pushed into the stream nobody cared sixpence forthe wasted time but the captain of the craft.Huck was already upon his watch when the ferryboats lights wentglinting past the wharf. He heard no noise on board for the youngpeople were as subdued and still as people usually are who are nearlytired to death. He wondered what boat it was and why she did not stopat the wharf and then he dropped her out of his mind and put hisattention upon his business. The night was growing cloudy and dark. Tenoclock came and the noise of vehicles ceased scattered lights beganto wink out all straggling footpassengers disappeared the villagebetook itself to its slumbers and left the small watcher alone with thesilence and the ghosts. Eleven oclock came and the tavern lights wereput out darkness everywhere now. Huck waited what seemed a weary longtime but nothing happened. His faith was weakening. Was there any useWas there really any use Why not give it up and turn inA noise fell upon his ear. He was all attention in an instant. Thealley door closed softly. He sprang to the corner of the brick store.The next moment two men brushed by him and one seemed to havesomething under his arm. It must be that box So they were going toremove the treasure. Why call Tom now It would be absurd the menwould get away with the box and never be found again. No he wouldstick to their wake and follow them he would trust to the darkness forsecurity from discovery. So communing with himself Huck stepped outand glided along behind the men catlike with bare feet allowingthem to keep just far enough ahead not to be invisible.They moved up the river street three blocks then turned to the leftup a crossstreet. They went straight ahead then until they came tothe path that led up Cardiff Hill this they took. They passed by theold Welshmans house halfway up the hill without hesitating andstill climbed upward. Good thought Huck they will bury it in the oldquarry. But they never stopped at the quarry. They passed on up thesummit. They plunged into the narrow path between the tall sumachbushes and were at once hidden in the gloom. Huck closed up andshortened his distance now for they would never be able to see him.He trotted along awhile then slackened his pace fearing he wasgaining too fast moved on a piece then stopped altogether listenedno sound none save that he seemed to hear the beating of his ownheart. The hooting of an owl came over the hill ominous sound But nofootsteps. Heavens was everything lost He was about to spring withwinged feet when a man cleared his throat not four feet from himHucks heart shot into his throat but he swallowed it again and thenhe stood there shaking as if a dozen agues had taken charge of him atonce and so weak that he thought he must surely fall to the ground. Heknew where he was. He knew he was within five steps of the stileleading into Widow Douglas grounds. Very well he thought let thembury it there it wont be hard to find.Now there was a voice a very low voice Injun JoesDamn her maybe shes got company theres lights late as it is.I cant see any.This was that strangers voice the stranger of the haunted house. Adeadly chill went to Hucks heart this then was the revenge jobHis thought was to fly. Then he remembered that the Widow Douglas hadbeen kind to him more than once and maybe these men were going tomurder her. He wished he dared venture to warn her but he knew hedidnt dare they might come and catch him. He thought all this andmore in the moment that elapsed between the strangers remark and InjunJoes next which was Because the bush is in your way. Now this way now you see dontyouYes. Well there IS company there I reckon. Better give it up.Give it up and I just leaving this country forever Give it up andmaybe never have another chance. I tell you again as Ive told youbefore I dont care for her swag you may have it. But her husband wasrough on me many times he was rough on me and mainly he was thejustice of the peace that jugged me for a vagrant. And that aint all.It aint a millionth part of it He had me HORSEWHIPPED horsewhippedin front of the jail like a nigger with all the town looking onHORSEWHIPPED do you understand He took advantage of me and died. ButIll take it out of HER.Oh dont kill her Dont do thatKill Who said anything about killing I would kill HIM if he washere but not her. When you want to get revenge on a woman you dontkill her bosh you go for her looks. You slit her nostrils you notchher ears like a sowBy God thats Keep your opinion to yourself It will be safest for you. Ill tieher to the bed. If she bleeds to death is that my fault Ill not cryif she does. My friend youll help me in this thing for MY sake thats why youre here I mightnt be able alone. If you flinch Illkill you. Do you understand that And if I have to kill you Ill killher and then I reckon nobodyll ever know much about who done thisbusiness.Well if its got to be done lets get at it. The quicker thebetter Im all in a shiver.Do it NOW And company there Look here Ill get suspicious of youfirst thing you know. No well wait till the lights are out theresno hurry.Huck felt that a silence was going to ensue a thing still more awfulthan any amount of murderous talk so he held his breath and steppedgingerly back planted his foot carefully and firmly after balancingonelegged in a precarious way and almost toppling over first on oneside and then on the other. He took another step back with the sameelaboration and the same risks then another and another and a twigsnapped under his foot His breath stopped and he listened. There wasno sound the stillness was perfect. His gratitude was measureless. Nowhe turned in his tracks between the walls of sumach bushes turnedhimself as carefully as if he were a ship and then stepped quickly butcautiously along. When he emerged at the quarry he felt secure and sohe picked up his nimble heels and flew. Down down he sped till hereached the Welshmans. He banged at the door and presently the headsof the old man and his two stalwart sons were thrust from windows.Whats the row there Whos banging What do you wantLet me in quick Ill tell everything.Why who are youHuckleberry Finn quick let me inHuckleberry Finn indeed It aint a name to open many doors Ijudge But let him in lads and lets see whats the trouble.Please dont ever tell I told you were Hucks first words when hegot in. Please dont Id be killed sure but the widows been goodfriends to me sometimes and I want to tell I WILL tell if youllpromise you wont ever say it was me.By George he HAS got something to tell or he wouldnt act soexclaimed the old man out with it and nobody herell ever tell lad.Three minutes later the old man and his sons well armed were up thehill and just entering the sumach path on tiptoe their weapons intheir hands. Huck accompanied them no further. He hid behind a greatbowlder and fell to listening. There was a lagging anxious silenceand then all of a sudden there was an explosion of firearms and a cry.Huck waited for no particulars. He sprang away and sped down the hillas fast as his legs could carry him.CHAPTER XXXAS the earliest suspicion of dawn appeared on Sunday morning Huckcame groping up the hill and rapped gently at the old Welshmans door.The inmates were asleep but it was a sleep that was set on ahairtrigger on account of the exciting episode of the night. A callcame from a windowWhos thereHucks scared voice answered in a low tonePlease let me in Its only Huck FinnIts a name that can open this door night or day lad and welcomeThese were strange words to the vagabond boys ears and thepleasantest he had ever heard. He could not recollect that the closingword had ever been applied in his case before. The door was quicklyunlocked and he entered. Huck was given a seat and the old man and hisbrace of tall sons speedily dressed themselves.Now my boy I hope youre good and hungry because breakfast will beready as soon as the suns up and well have a piping hot one too make yourself easy about that I and the boys hoped youd turn up andstop here last night.I was awful scared said Huck and I run. I took out when thepistols went off and I didnt stop for three mile. Ive come now becuzI wanted to know about it you know and I come before daylight becuz Ididnt want to run across them devils even if they was dead.Well poor chap you do look as if youd had a hard night of it buttheres a bed here for you when youve had your breakfast. No theyaint dead lad we are sorry enough for that. You see we knew rightwhere to put our hands on them by your description so we crept alongon tiptoe till we got within fifteen feet of them dark as a cellarthat sumach path was and just then I found I was going to sneeze. Itwas the meanest kind of luck I tried to keep it back but no use twas bound to come and it did come I was in the lead with my pistolraised and when the sneeze started those scoundrels arustling to getout of the path I sung out Fire boys and blazed away at the placewhere the rustling was. So did the boys. But they were off in a jiffythose villains and we after them down through the woods. I judge wenever touched them. They fired a shot apiece as they started but theirbullets whizzed by and didnt do us any harm. As soon as we lost thesound of their feet we quit chasing and went down and stirred up theconstables. They got a posse together and went off to guard the riverbank and as soon as it is light the sheriff and a gang are going tobeat up the woods. My boys will be with them presently. I wish we hadsome sort of description of those rascals twould help a good deal.But you couldnt see what they were like in the dark lad I supposeOh yes I saw them downtown and follered them.Splendid Describe them describe them my boyOnes the old deaf and dumb Spaniard thats ben around here once ortwice and tothers a meanlooking ragged Thats enough lad we know the men Happened on them in the woodsback of the widows one day and they slunk away. Off with you boysand tell the sheriff get your breakfast tomorrow morningThe Welshmans sons departed at once. As they were leaving the roomHuck sprang up and exclaimedOh please dont tell ANYbody it was me that blowed on them OhpleaseAll right if you say it Huck but you ought to have the credit ofwhat you did.Oh no no Please dont tellWhen the young men were gone the old Welshman saidThey wont tell and I wont. But why dont you want it knownHuck would not explain further than to say that he already knew toomuch about one of those men and would not have the man know that heknew anything against him for the whole world he would be killed forknowing it sure.The old man promised secrecy once more and saidHow did you come to follow these fellows lad Were they lookingsuspiciousHuck was silent while he framed a duly cautious reply. Then he saidWell you see Im a kind of a hard lot least everybody says soand I dont see nothing agin it and sometimes I cant sleep much onaccount of thinking about it and sort of trying to strike out a new wayof doing. That was the way of it last night. I couldnt sleep and so Icome along upstreet bout midnight aturning it all over and when Igot to that old shackly brick store by the Temperance Tavern I backedup agin the wall to have another think. Well just then along comesthese two chaps slipping along close by me with something under theirarm and I reckoned theyd stole it. One was asmoking and tother onewanted a light so they stopped right before me and the cigars lit uptheir faces and I see that the big one was the deaf and dumb Spaniardby his white whiskers and the patch on his eye and tother one was arusty raggedlooking devil.Could you see the rags by the light of the cigarsThis staggered Huck for a moment. Then he saidWell I dont know but somehow it seems as if I did.Then they went on and you Follered em yes. That was it. I wanted to see what was up theysneaked along so. I dogged em to the widders stile and stood in thedark and heard the ragged one beg for the widder and the Spaniardswear hed spile her looks just as I told you and your two What The DEAF AND DUMB man said all thatHuck had made another terrible mistake He was trying his best to keepthe old man from getting the faintest hint of who the Spaniard mightbe and yet his tongue seemed determined to get him into trouble inspite of all he could do. He made several efforts to creep out of hisscrape but the old mans eye was upon him and he made blunder afterblunder. Presently the Welshman saidMy boy dont be afraid of me. I wouldnt hurt a hair of your headfor all the world. No Id protect you Id protect you. This Spaniardis not deaf and dumb youve let that slip without intending it youcant cover that up now. You know something about that Spaniard thatyou want to keep dark. Now trust me tell me what it is and trust me I wont betray you.Huck looked into the old mans honest eyes a moment then bent overand whispered in his earTaint a Spaniard its Injun JoeThe Welshman almost jumped out of his chair. In a moment he saidIts all plain enough now. When you talked about notching ears andslitting noses I judged that that was your own embellishment becausewhite men dont take that sort of revenge. But an Injun Thats adifferent matter altogether.During breakfast the talk went on and in the course of it the old mansaid that the last thing which he and his sons had done before goingto bed was to get a lantern and examine the stile and its vicinity formarks of blood. They found none but captured a bulky bundle of Of WHATIf the words had been lightning they could not have leaped with a morestunning suddenness from Hucks blanched lips. His eyes were staringwide now and his breath suspended waiting for the answer. TheWelshman started stared in return three seconds five seconds ten then repliedOf burglars tools. Why whats the MATTER with youHuck sank back panting gently but deeply unutterably grateful. TheWelshman eyed him gravely curiously and presently saidYes burglars tools. That appears to relieve you a good deal. Butwhat did give you that turn What were YOU expecting wed foundHuck was in a close place the inquiring eye was upon him he wouldhave given anything for material for a plausible answer nothingsuggested itself the inquiring eye was boring deeper and deeper asenseless reply offered there was no time to weigh it so at a venturehe uttered it feeblySundayschool books maybe.Poor Huck was too distressed to smile but the old man laughed loudand joyously shook up the details of his anatomy from head to footand ended by saying that such a laugh was money in amans pocketbecause it cut down the doctors bill like everything. Then he addedPoor old chap youre white and jaded you aint well a bit nowonder youre a little flighty and off your balance. But youll comeout of it. Rest and sleep will fetch you out all right I hope.Huck was irritated to think he had been such a goose and betrayed sucha suspicious excitement for he had dropped the idea that the parcelbrought from the tavern was the treasure as soon as he had heard thetalk at the widows stile. He had only thought it was not the treasurehowever he had not known that it wasnt and so the suggestion of acaptured bundle was too much for his selfpossession. But on the wholehe felt glad the little episode had happened for now he knew beyondall question that that bundle was not THE bundle and so his mind wasat rest and exceedingly comfortable. In fact everything seemed to bedrifting just in the right direction now the treasure must be stillin No. the men would be captured and jailed that day and he and Tomcould seize the gold that night without any trouble or any fear ofinterruption.Just as breakfast was completed there was a knock at the door. Huckjumped for a hidingplace for he had no mind to be connected evenremotely with the late event. The Welshman admitted several ladies andgentlemen among them the Widow Douglas and noticed that groups ofcitizens were climbing up the hill to stare at the stile. So the newshad spread. The Welshman had to tell the story of the night to thevisitors. The widows gratitude for her preservation was outspoken.Dont say a word about it madam. Theres another that youre morebeholden to than you are to me and my boys maybe but he dont allowme to tell his name. We wouldnt have been there but for him.Of course this excited a curiosity so vast that it almost belittledthe main matter but the Welshman allowed it to eat into the vitals ofhis visitors and through them be transmitted to the whole town for herefused to part with his secret. When all else had been learned thewidow saidI went to sleep reading in bed and slept straight through all thatnoise. Why didnt you come and wake meWe judged it warnt worth while. Those fellows warnt likely to comeagain they hadnt any tools left to work with and what was the use ofwaking you up and scaring you to death My three negro men stood guardat your house all the rest of the night. Theyve just come back.More visitors came and the story had to be told and retold for acouple of hours more.There was no Sabbathschool during dayschool vacation but everybodywas early at church. The stirring event was well canvassed. News camethat not a sign of the two villains had been yet discovered. When thesermon was finished Judge Thatchers wife dropped alongside of Mrs.Harper as she moved down the aisle with the crowd and saidIs my Becky going to sleep all day I just expected she would betired to death.Your BeckyYes with a startled look didnt she stay with you last nightWhy no.Mrs. Thatcher turned pale and sank into a pew just as Aunt Pollytalking briskly with a friend passed by. Aunt Polly saidGoodmorning Mrs. Thatcher. Goodmorning Mrs. Harper. Ive got aboy thats turned up missing. I reckon my Tom stayed at your house lastnight one of you. And now hes afraid to come to church. Ive got tosettle with him.Mrs. Thatcher shook her head feebly and turned paler than ever.He didnt stay with us said Mrs. Harper beginning to look uneasy.A marked anxiety came into Aunt Pollys face.Joe Harper have you seen my Tom this morningNom.When did you see him lastJoe tried to remember but was not sure he could say. The people hadstopped moving out of church. Whispers passed along and a bodinguneasiness took possession of every countenance. Children wereanxiously questioned and young teachers. They all said they had notnoticed whether Tom and Becky were on board the ferryboat on thehomeward trip it was dark no one thought of inquiring if any one wasmissing. One young man finally blurted out his fear that they werestill in the cave Mrs. Thatcher swooned away. Aunt Polly fell tocrying and wringing her hands.The alarm swept from lip to lip from group to group from street tostreet and within five minutes the bells were wildly clanging and thewhole town was up The Cardiff Hill episode sank into instantinsignificance the burglars were forgotten horses were saddledskiffs were manned the ferryboat ordered out and before the horrorwas half an hour old two hundred men were pouring down highroad andriver toward the cave.All the long afternoon the village seemed empty and dead. Many womenvisited Aunt Polly and Mrs. Thatcher and tried to comfort them. Theycried with them too and that was still better than words. All thetedious night the town waited for news but when the morning dawned atlast all the word that came was Send more candles and send food.Mrs. Thatcher was almost crazed and Aunt Polly also. Judge Thatchersent messages of hope and encouragement from the cave but theyconveyed no real cheer.The old Welshman came home toward daylight spattered withcandlegrease smeared with clay and almost worn out. He found Huckstill in the bed that had been provided for him and delirious withfever. The physicians were all at the cave so the Widow Douglas cameand took charge of the patient. She said she would do her best by himbecause whether he was good bad or indifferent he was the Lordsand nothing that was the Lords was a thing to be neglected. TheWelshman said Huck had good spots in him and the widow saidYou can depend on it. Thats the Lords mark. He dont leave it off.He never does. Puts it somewhere on every creature that comes from hishands.Early in the forenoon parties of jaded men began to straggle into thevillage but the strongest of the citizens continued searching. All thenews that could be gained was that remotenesses of the cavern werebeing ransacked that had never been visited before that every cornerand crevice was going to be thoroughly searched that wherever onewandered through the maze of passages lights were to be seen flittinghither and thither in the distance and shoutings and pistolshots senttheir hollow reverberations to the ear down the sombre aisles. In oneplace far from the section usually traversed by tourists the namesBECKY TOM had been found traced upon the rocky wall withcandlesmoke and near at hand a greasesoiled bit of ribbon. Mrs.Thatcher recognized the ribbon and cried over it. She said it was thelast relic she should ever have of her child and that no other memorialof her could ever be so precious because this one parted latest fromthe living body before the awful death came. Some said that now andthen in the cave a faraway speck of light would glimmer and then aglorious shout would burst forth and a score of men go trooping down theechoing aisle and then a sickening disappointment always followed thechildren were not there it was only a searchers light.Three dreadful days and nights dragged their tedious hours along andthe village sank into a hopeless stupor. No one had heart for anything.The accidental discovery just made that the proprietor of theTemperance Tavern kept liquor on his premises scarcely fluttered thepublic pulse tremendous as the fact was. In a lucid interval Huckfeebly led up to the subject of taverns and finally asked dimlydreading the worst if anything had been discovered at the TemperanceTavern since he had been ill.Yes said the widow.Huck started up in bed wildeyedWhat What was itLiquor and the place has been shut up. Lie down child what a turnyou did give meOnly tell me just one thing only just one please Was it Tom Sawyerthat found itThe widow burst into tears. Hush hush child hush Ive told youbefore you must NOT talk. You are very very sickThen nothing but liquor had been found there would have been a greatpowwow if it had been the gold. So the treasure was gone forever goneforever But what could she be crying about Curious that she shouldcry.These thoughts worked their dim way through Hucks mind and under theweariness they gave him he fell asleep. The widow said to herselfThere hes asleep poor wreck. Tom Sawyer find it Pity but somebodycould find Tom Sawyer Ah there aint many left now thats got hopeenough or strength enough either to go on searching.CHAPTER XXXINOW to return to Tom and Beckys share in the picnic. They trippedalong the murky aisles with the rest of the company visiting thefamiliar wonders of the cave wonders dubbed with ratheroverdescriptive names such as The DrawingRoom The CathedralAladdins Palace and so on. Presently the hideandseek frolickingbegan and Tom and Becky engaged in it with zeal until the exertionbegan to grow a trifle wearisome then they wandered down a sinuousavenue holding their candles aloft and reading the tangled webwork ofnames dates postoffice addresses and mottoes with which the rockywalls had been frescoed in candlesmoke. Still drifting along andtalking they scarcely noticed that they were now in a part of the cavewhose walls were not frescoed. They smoked their own names under anoverhanging shelf and moved on. Presently they came to a place where alittle stream of water trickling over a ledge and carrying a limestonesediment with it had in the slowdragging ages formed a laced andruffled Niagara in gleaming and imperishable stone. Tom squeezed hissmall body behind it in order to illuminate it for Beckysgratification. He found that it curtained a sort of steep naturalstairway which was enclosed between narrow walls and at once theambition to be a discoverer seized him. Becky responded to his calland they made a smokemark for future guidance and started upon theirquest. They wound this way and that far down into the secret depths ofthe cave made another mark and branched off in search of novelties totell the upper world about. In one place they found a spacious cavernfrom whose ceiling depended a multitude of shining stalactites of thelength and circumference of a mans leg they walked all about itwondering and admiring and presently left it by one of the numerouspassages that opened into it. This shortly brought them to a bewitchingspring whose basin was incrusted with a frostwork of glitteringcrystals it was in the midst of a cavern whose walls were supported bymany fantastic pillars which had been formed by the joining of greatstalactites and stalagmites together the result of the ceaselesswaterdrip of centuries. Under the roof vast knots of bats had packedthemselves together thousands in a bunch the lights disturbed thecreatures and they came flocking down by hundreds squeaking anddarting furiously at the candles. Tom knew their ways and the danger ofthis sort of conduct. He seized Beckys hand and hurried her into thefirst corridor that offered and none too soon for a bat struckBeckys light out with its wing while she was passing out of thecavern. The bats chased the children a good distance but the fugitivesplunged into every new passage that offered and at last got rid of theperilous things. Tom found a subterranean lake shortly whichstretched its dim length away until its shape was lost in the shadows.He wanted to explore its borders but concluded that it would be bestto sit down and rest awhile first. Now for the first time the deepstillness of the place laid a clammy hand upon the spirits of thechildren. Becky saidWhy I didnt notice but it seems ever so long since I heard any ofthe others.Come to think Becky we are away down below them and I dont knowhow far away north or south or east or whichever it is. We couldnthear them here.Becky grew apprehensive.I wonder how long weve been down here Tom We better start back.Yes I reckon we better. Praps we better.Can you find the way Tom Its all a mixedup crookedness to me.I reckon I could find it but then the bats. If they put our candlesout it will be an awful fix. Lets try some other way so as not to gothrough there.Well. But I hope we wont get lost. It would be so awful and thegirl shuddered at the thought of the dreadful possibilities.They started through a corridor and traversed it in silence a longway glancing at each new opening to see if there was anythingfamiliar about the look of it but they were all strange. Every timeTom made an examination Becky would watch his face for an encouragingsign and he would say cheerilyOh its all right. This aint the one but well come to it rightawayBut he felt less and less hopeful with each failure and presentlybegan to turn off into diverging avenues at sheer random in desperatehope of finding the one that was wanted. He still said it was allright but there was such a leaden dread at his heart that the wordshad lost their ring and sounded just as if he had said All is lostBecky clung to his side in an anguish of fear and tried hard to keepback the tears but they would come. At last she saidOh Tom never mind the bats lets go back that way We seem to getworse and worse off all the time.Listen said he.Profound silence silence so deep that even their breathings wereconspicuous in the hush. Tom shouted. The call went echoing down theempty aisles and died out in the distance in a faint sound thatresembled a ripple of mocking laughter.Oh dont do it again Tom it is too horrid said Becky.It is horrid but I better Becky they might hear us you know andhe shouted again.The might was even a chillier horror than the ghostly laughter itso confessed a perishing hope. The children stood still and listenedbut there was no result. Tom turned upon the back track at once andhurried his steps. It was but a little while before a certainindecision in his manner revealed another fearful fact to Becky hecould not find his way backOh Tom you didnt make any marksBecky I was such a fool Such a fool I never thought we might wantto come back No I cant find the way. Its all mixed up.Tom Tom were lost were lost We never can get out of this awfulplace Oh why DID we ever leave the othersShe sank to the ground and burst into such a frenzy of crying that Tomwas appalled with the idea that she might die or lose her reason. Hesat down by her and put his arms around her she buried her face in hisbosom she clung to him she poured out her terrors her unavailingregrets and the far echoes turned them all to jeering laughter. Tombegged her to pluck up hope again and she said she could not. He fellto blaming and abusing himself for getting her into this miserablesituation this had a better effect. She said she would try to hopeagain she would get up and follow wherever he might lead if only hewould not talk like that any more. For he was no more to blame thanshe she said.So they moved on again aimlessly simply at random all they could dowas to move keep moving. For a little while hope made a show ofreviving not with any reason to back it but only because it is itsnature to revive when the spring has not been taken out of it by ageand familiarity with failure.Byandby Tom took Beckys candle and blew it out. This economy meantso much Words were not needed. Becky understood and her hope diedagain. She knew that Tom had a whole candle and three or four pieces inhis pockets yet he must economize.Byandby fatigue began to assert its claims the children tried topay attention for it was dreadful to think of sitting down when timewas grown to be so precious moving in some direction in anydirection was at least progress and might bear fruit but to sit downwas to invite death and shorten its pursuit.At last Beckys frail limbs refused to carry her farther. She satdown. Tom rested with her and they talked of home and the friendsthere and the comfortable beds and above all the light Becky criedand Tom tried to think of some way of comforting her but all hisencouragements were grown threadbare with use and sounded likesarcasms. Fatigue bore so heavily upon Becky that she drowsed off tosleep. Tom was grateful. He sat looking into her drawn face and saw itgrow smooth and natural under the influence of pleasant dreams andbyandby a smile dawned and rested there. The peaceful face reflectedsomewhat of peace and healing into his own spirit and his thoughtswandered away to bygone times and dreamy memories. While he was deep inhis musings Becky woke up with a breezy little laugh but it wasstricken dead upon her lips and a groan followed it.Oh how COULD I sleep I wish I never never had waked No No Idont Tom Dont look so I wont say it again.Im glad youve slept Becky youll feel rested now and well findthe way out.We can try Tom but Ive seen such a beautiful country in my dream.I reckon we are going there.Maybe not maybe not. Cheer up Becky and lets go on trying.They rose up and wandered along hand in hand and hopeless. They triedto estimate how long they had been in the cave but all they knew wasthat it seemed days and weeks and yet it was plain that this could notbe for their candles were not gone yet. A long time after this theycould not tell how long Tom said they must go softly and listen fordripping water they must find a spring. They found one presently andTom said it was time to rest again. Both were cruelly tired yet Beckysaid she thought she could go a little farther. She was surprised tohear Tom dissent. She could not understand it. They sat down and Tomfastened his candle to the wall in front of them with some clay.Thought was soon busy nothing was said for some time. Then Becky brokethe silenceTom I am so hungryTom took something out of his pocket.Do you remember this said he.Becky almost smiled.Its our weddingcake Tom.Yes I wish it was as big as a barrel for its all weve got.I saved it from the picnic for us to dream on Tom the way grownuppeople do with weddingcake but itll be our She dropped the sentence where it was. Tom divided the cake and Beckyate with good appetite while Tom nibbled at his moiety. There wasabundance of cold water to finish the feast with. Byandby Beckysuggested that they move on again. Tom was silent a moment. Then hesaidBecky can you bear it if I tell you somethingBeckys face paled but she thought she could.Well then Becky we must stay here where theres water to drink.That little piece is our last candleBecky gave loose to tears and wailings. Tom did what he could tocomfort her but with little effect. At length Becky saidTomWell BeckyTheyll miss us and hunt for usYes they will Certainly they willMaybe theyre hunting for us now Tom.Why I reckon maybe they are. I hope they are.When would they miss us TomWhen they get back to the boat I reckon.Tom it might be dark then would they notice we hadnt comeI dont know. But anyway your mother would miss you as soon as theygot home.A frightened look in Beckys face brought Tom to his senses and he sawthat he had made a blunder. Becky was not to have gone home that nightThe children became silent and thoughtful. In a moment a new burst ofgrief from Becky showed Tom that the thing in his mind had struck hersalso that the Sabbath morning might be half spent before Mrs. Thatcherdiscovered that Becky was not at Mrs. Harpers.The children fastened their eyes upon their bit of candle and watchedit melt slowly and pitilessly away saw the half inch of wick standalone at last saw the feeble flame rise and fall climb the thincolumn of smoke linger at its top a moment and then the horror ofutter darkness reignedHow long afterward it was that Becky came to a slow consciousness thatshe was crying in Toms arms neither could tell. All that they knewwas that after what seemed a mighty stretch of time both awoke out ofa dead stupor of sleep and resumed their miseries once more. Tom saidit might be Sunday now maybe Monday. He tried to get Becky to talkbut her sorrows were too oppressive all her hopes were gone. Tom saidthat they must have been missed long ago and no doubt the search wasgoing on. He would shout and maybe some one would come. He tried itbut in the darkness the distant echoes sounded so hideously that hetried it no more.The hours wasted away and hunger came to torment the captives again.A portion of Toms half of the cake was left they divided and ate it.But they seemed hungrier than before. The poor morsel of food onlywhetted desire.Byandby Tom saidSH Did you hear thatBoth held their breath and listened. There was a sound like thefaintest faroff shout. Instantly Tom answered it and leading Beckyby the hand started groping down the corridor in its direction.Presently he listened again again the sound was heard and apparentlya little nearer.Its them said Tom theyre coming Come along Becky were allright nowThe joy of the prisoners was almost overwhelming. Their speed wasslow however because pitfalls were somewhat common and had to beguarded against. They shortly came to one and had to stop. It might bethree feet deep it might be a hundred there was no passing it at anyrate. Tom got down on his breast and reached as far down as he could.No bottom. They must stay there and wait until the searchers came. Theylistened evidently the distant shoutings were growing more distant amoment or two more and they had gone altogether. The heartsinkingmisery of it Tom whooped until he was hoarse but it was of no use. Hetalked hopefully to Becky but an age of anxious waiting passed and nosounds came again.The children groped their way back to the spring. The weary timedragged on they slept again and awoke famished and woestricken. Tombelieved it must be Tuesday by this time.Now an idea struck him. There were some side passages near at hand. Itwould be better to explore some of these than bear the weight of theheavy time in idleness. He took a kiteline from his pocket tied it toa projection and he and Becky started Tom in the lead unwinding theline as he groped along. At the end of twenty steps the corridor endedin a jumpingoff place. Tom got down on his knees and felt below andthen as far around the corner as he could reach with his handsconveniently he made an effort to stretch yet a little farther to theright and at that moment not twenty yards away a human hand holdinga candle appeared from behind a rock Tom lifted up a glorious shoutand instantly that hand was followed by the body it belonged to InjunJoes Tom was paralyzed he could not move. He was vastly gratifiedthe next moment to see the Spaniard take to his heels and gethimself out of sight. Tom wondered that Joe had not recognized hisvoice and come over and killed him for testifying in court. But theechoes must have disguised the voice. Without doubt that was it hereasoned. Toms fright weakened every muscle in his body. He said tohimself that if he had strength enough to get back to the spring hewould stay there and nothing should tempt him to run the risk ofmeeting Injun Joe again. He was careful to keep from Becky what it washe had seen. He told her he had only shouted for luck.But hunger and wretchedness rise superior to fears in the long run.Another tedious wait at the spring and another long sleep broughtchanges. The children awoke tortured with a raging hunger. Tom believedthat it must be Wednesday or Thursday or even Friday or Saturday nowand that the search had been given over. He proposed to explore anotherpassage. He felt willing to risk Injun Joe and all other terrors. ButBecky was very weak. She had sunk into a dreary apathy and would not beroused. She said she would wait now where she was and die it wouldnot be long. She told Tom to go with the kiteline and explore if hechose but she implored him to come back every little while and speakto her and she made him promise that when the awful time came hewould stay by her and hold her hand until all was over.Tom kissed her with a choking sensation in his throat and made ashow of being confident of finding the searchers or an escape from thecave then he took the kiteline in his hand and went groping down oneof the passages on his hands and knees distressed with hunger and sickwith bodings of coming doom.CHAPTER XXXIITUESDAY afternoon came and waned to the twilight. The village of St.Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Publicprayers had been offered up for them and many and many a privateprayer that had the petitioners whole heart in it but still no goodnews came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up thequest and gone back to their daily avocations saying that it was plainthe children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill and agreat part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking tohear her call her child and raise her head and listen a whole minuteat a time then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly haddrooped into a settled melancholy and her gray hair had grown almostwhite. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night sad and forlorn.Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the villagebells and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic halfcladpeople who shouted Turn out turn out theyre found theyrefound Tin pans and horns were added to the din the population masseditself and moved toward the river met the children coming in an opencarriage drawn by shouting citizens thronged around it joined itshomeward march and swept magnificently up the main street roaringhuzzah after huzzahThe village was illuminated nobody went to bed again it was thegreatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first halfhoura procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatchers house seizedthe saved ones and kissed them squeezed Mrs. Thatchers hand tried tospeak but couldnt and drifted out raining tears all over the place.Aunt Pollys happiness was complete and Mrs. Thatchers nearly so. Itwould be complete however as soon as the messenger dispatched withthe great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom layupon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history ofthe wonderful adventure putting in many striking additions to adorn itwithal and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went onan exploring expedition how he followed two avenues as far as hiskiteline would reach how he followed a third to the fullest stretch ofthe kiteline and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a faroffspeck that looked like daylight dropped the line and groped toward itpushed his head and shoulders through a small hole and saw the broadMississippi rolling by And if it had only happened to be night he wouldnot have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored thatpassage any more He told how he went back for Becky and broke the goodnews and she told him not to fret her with such stuff for she wastired and knew she was going to die and wanted to. He described how helabored with her and convinced her and how she almost died for joy whenshe had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight howhe pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out how they satthere and cried for gladness how some men came along in a skiff and Tomhailed them and told them their situation and their famished conditionhow the men didnt believe the wild tale at first because said theyyou are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in then took them aboard rowed to a house gave them supper made themrest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.Before daydawn Judge Thatcher and the handful of searchers with himwere tracked out in the cave by the twine clews they had strungbehind them and informed of the great news.Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to beshaken off at once as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They werebedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday and seemed to grow more andmore tired and worn all the time. Tom got about a little onThursday was downtown Friday and nearly as whole as ever Saturdaybut Becky did not leave her room until Sunday and then she looked asif she had passed through a wasting illness.Tom learned of Hucks sickness and went to see him on Friday butcould not be admitted to the bedroom neither could he on Saturday orSunday. He was admitted daily after that but was warned to keep stillabout his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglasstayed by to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the CardiffHill event also that the ragged mans body had eventually been foundin the river near the ferrylanding he had been drowned while tryingto escape perhaps.About a fortnight after Toms rescue from the cave he started off tovisit Huck who had grown plenty strong enough now to hear excitingtalk and Tom had some that would interest him he thought. JudgeThatchers house was on Toms way and he stopped to see Becky. TheJudge and some friends set Tom to talking and some one asked himironically if he wouldnt like to go to the cave again. Tom said hethought he wouldnt mind it. The Judge saidWell there are others just like you Tom Ive not the least doubt.But we have taken care of that. Nobody will get lost in that cave anymore.WhyBecause I had its big door sheathed with boiler iron two weeks agoand triplelocked and Ive got the keys.Tom turned as white as a sheet.Whats the matter boy Here run somebody Fetch a glass of waterThe water was brought and thrown into Toms face.Ah now youre all right. What was the matter with you TomOh Judge Injun Joes in the caveCHAPTER XXXIIIWITHIN a few minutes the news had spread and a dozen skiffloads ofmen were on their way to McDougals cave and the ferryboat wellfilled with passengers soon followed. Tom Sawyer was in the skiff thatbore Judge Thatcher.When the cave door was unlocked a sorrowful sight presented itself inthe dim twilight of the place. Injun Joe lay stretched upon the grounddead with his face close to the crack of the door as if his longingeyes had been fixed to the latest moment upon the light and the cheerof the free world outside. Tom was touched for he knew by his ownexperience how this wretch had suffered. His pity was moved butnevertheless he felt an abounding sense of relief and security nowwhich revealed to him in a degree which he had not fully appreciatedbefore how vast a weight of dread had been lying upon him since the dayhe lifted his voice against this bloodyminded outcast.Injun Joes bowieknife lay close by its blade broken in two. Thegreat foundationbeam of the door had been chipped and hacked throughwith tedious labor useless labor too it was for the native rockformed a sill outside it and upon that stubborn material the knife hadwrought no effect the only damage done was to the knife itself. But ifthere had been no stony obstruction there the labor would have beenuseless still for if the beam had been wholly cut away Injun Joe couldnot have squeezed his body under the door and he knew it. So he hadonly hacked that place in order to be doing something in order to passthe weary time in order to employ his tortured faculties. Ordinarilyone could find half a dozen bits of candle stuck around in the crevicesof this vestibule left there by tourists but there were none now. Theprisoner had searched them out and eaten them. He had also contrived tocatch a few bats and these also he had eaten leaving only theirclaws. The poor unfortunate had starved to death. In one place near athand a stalagmite had been slowly growing up from the ground for agesbuilded by the waterdrip from a stalactite overhead. The captive hadbroken off the stalagmite and upon the stump had placed a stonewherein he had scooped a shallow hollow to catch the precious dropthat fell once in every three minutes with the dreary regularity of aclocktick a dessertspoonful once in four and twenty hours. That dropwas falling when the Pyramids were new when Troy fell when thefoundations of Rome were laid when Christ was crucified when theConqueror created the British empire when Columbus sailed when themassacre at Lexington was news. It is falling now it will still befalling when all these things shall have sunk down the afternoon ofhistory and the twilight of tradition and been swallowed up in thethick night of oblivion. Has everything a purpose and a mission Didthis drop fall patiently during five thousand years to be ready forthis flitting human insects need and has it another important objectto accomplish ten thousand years to come No matter. It is many andmany a year since the hapless halfbreed scooped out the stone to catchthe priceless drops but to this day the tourist stares longest at thatpathetic stone and that slowdropping water when he comes to see thewonders of McDougals cave. Injun Joes cup stands first in the list ofthe caverns marvels even Aladdins Palace cannot rival it.Injun Joe was buried near the mouth of the cave and people flockedthere in boats and wagons from the towns and from all the farms andhamlets for seven miles around they brought their children and allsorts of provisions and confessed that they had had almost assatisfactory a time at the funeral as they could have had at thehanging.This funeral stopped the further growth of one thing the petition tothe governor for Injun Joes pardon. The petition had been largelysigned many tearful and eloquent meetings had been held and acommittee of sappy women been appointed to go in deep mourning and wailaround the governor and implore him to be a merciful ass and tramplehis duty under foot. Injun Joe was believed to have killed fivecitizens of the village but what of that If he had been Satan himselfthere would have been plenty of weaklings ready to scribble their namesto a pardonpetition and drip a tear on it from their permanentlyimpaired and leaky waterworks.The morning after the funeral Tom took Huck to a private place to havean important talk. Huck had learned all about Toms adventure from theWelshman and the Widow Douglas by this time but Tom said he reckonedthere was one thing they had not told him that thing was what hewanted to talk about now. Hucks face saddened. He saidI know what it is. You got into No. and never found anything butwhiskey. Nobody told me it was you but I just knowed it must a benyou soon as I heard bout that whiskey business and I knowed youhadnt got the money becuz youd a got at me some way or other andtold me even if you was mum to everybody else. Tom somethings alwaystold me wed never get holt of that swag.Why Huck I never told on that tavernkeeper. YOU know his tavernwas all right the Saturday I went to the picnic. Dont you remember youwas to watch there that nightOh yes Why it seems bout a year ago. It was that very night that Ifollered Injun Joe to the widders.YOU followed himYes but you keep mum. I reckon Injun Joes left friends behind himand I dont want em souring on me and doing me mean tricks. If ithadnt ben for me hed be down in Texas now all right.Then Huck told his entire adventure in confidence to Tom who had onlyheard of the Welshmans part of it before.Well said Huck presently coming back to the main questionwhoever nipped the whiskey in No. nipped the money too I reckon anyways its a goner for us Tom.Huck that money wasnt ever in No. What Huck searched his comrades face keenly. Tom have you got onthe track of that money againHuck its in the caveHucks eyes blazed.Say it again Tom.The moneys in the caveTom honest injun now is it fun or earnestEarnest Huck just as earnest as ever I was in my life. Will you goin there with me and help get it outI bet I will I will if its where we can blaze our way to it and notget lost.Huck we can do that without the least little bit of trouble in theworld.Good as wheat What makes you think the moneys Huck you just wait till we get in there. If we dont find it Illagree to give you my drum and every thing Ive got in the world. Iwill by jings.All right its a whiz. When do you sayRight now if you say it. Are you strong enoughIs it far in the cave I ben on my pins a little three or four daysnow but I cant walk moren a mile Tom least I dont think I could.Its about five mile into there the way anybody but me would goHuck but theres a mighty short cut that they dont anybody but meknow about. Huck Ill take you right to it in a skiff. Ill float theskiff down there and Ill pull it back again all by myself. Youneednt ever turn your hand over.Less start right off Tom.All right. We want some bread and meat and our pipes and a littlebag or two and two or three kitestrings and some of thesenewfangled things they call lucifer matches. I tell you manysthe time I wished I had some when I was in there before.A trifle after noon the boys borrowed a small skiff from a citizen whowas absent and got under way at once. When they were several milesbelow Cave Hollow Tom saidNow you see this bluff here looks all alike all the way down from thecave hollow no houses no woodyards bushes all alike. But do you seethat white place up yonder where theres been a landslide Well thatsone of my marks. Well get ashore now.They landed.Now Huck where were astanding you could touch that hole I got outof with a fishingpole. See if you can find it.Huck searched all the place about and found nothing. Tom proudlymarched into a thick clump of sumach bushes and saidHere you are Look at it Huck its the snuggest hole in thiscountry. You just keep mum about it. All along Ive been wanting to bea robber but I knew Id got to have a thing like this and where torun across it was the bother. Weve got it now and well keep itquiet only well let Joe Harper and Ben Rogers in because of coursetheres got to be a Gang or else there wouldnt be any style about it.Tom Sawyers Gang it sounds splendid dont it HuckWell it just does Tom. And wholl we robOh most anybody. Waylay people thats mostly the way.And kill themNo not always. Hive them in the cave till they raise a ransom.Whats a ransomMoney. You make them raise all they can offn their friends andafter youve kept them a year if it aint raised then you kill them.Thats the general way. Only you dont kill the women. You shut up thewomen but you dont kill them. Theyre always beautiful and rich andawfully scared. You take their watches and things but you always takeyour hat off and talk polite. They aint anybody as polite as robbers youll see that in any book. Well the women get to loving you andafter theyve been in the cave a week or two weeks they stop crying andafter that you couldnt get them to leave. If you drove them out theydturn right around and come back. Its so in all the books.Why its real bully Tom. I believe its bettern to be a pirate.Yes its better in some ways because its close to home andcircuses and all that.By this time everything was ready and the boys entered the hole Tomin the lead. They toiled their way to the farther end of the tunnelthen made their spliced kitestrings fast and moved on. A few stepsbrought them to the spring and Tom felt a shudder quiver all throughhim. He showed Huck the fragment of candlewick perched on a lump ofclay against the wall and described how he and Becky had watched theflame struggle and expire.The boys began to quiet down to whispers now for the stillness andgloom of the place oppressed their spirits. They went on and presentlyentered and followed Toms other corridor until they reached thejumpingoff place. The candles revealed the fact that it was notreally a precipice but only a steep clay hill twenty or thirty feethigh. Tom whisperedNow Ill show you something Huck.He held his candle aloft and saidLook as far around the corner as you can. Do you see that There onthe big rock over yonder done with candlesmoke.Tom its a CROSSNOW wheres your Number Two UNDER THE CROSS hey Right yonderswhere I saw Injun Joe poke up his candle HuckHuck stared at the mystic sign awhile and then said with a shaky voiceTom less git out of hereWhat and leave the treasureYes leave it. Injun Joes ghost is round about there certain.No it aint Huck no it aint. It would hant the place where hedied away out at the mouth of the cave five mile from here.No Tom it wouldnt. It would hang round the money. I know the waysof ghosts and so do you.Tom began to fear that Huck was right. Misgivings gathered in hismind. But presently an idea occurred to him Lookyhere Huck what fools were making of ourselves Injun Joesghost aint a going to come around where theres a crossThe point was well taken. It had its effect.Tom I didnt think of that. But thats so. Its luck for us thatcross is. I reckon well climb down there and have a hunt for that box.Tom went first cutting rude steps in the clay hill as he descended.Huck followed. Four avenues opened out of the small cavern which thegreat rock stood in. The boys examined three of them with no result.They found a small recess in the one nearest the base of the rock witha pallet of blankets spread down in it also an old suspender somebacon rind and the wellgnawed bones of two or three fowls. But therewas no moneybox. The lads searched and researched this place but invain. Tom saidHe said UNDER the cross. Well this comes nearest to being under thecross. It cant be under the rock itself because that sets solid onthe ground.They searched everywhere once more and then sat down discouraged.Huck could suggest nothing. Byandby Tom saidLookyhere Huck theres footprints and some candlegrease on theclay about one side of this rock but not on the other sides. Nowwhats that for I bet you the money IS under the rock. Im going todig in the clay.That aint no bad notion Tom said Huck with animation.Toms real Barlow was out at once and he had not dug four inchesbefore he struck wood.Hey Huck you hear thatHuck began to dig and scratch now. Some boards were soon uncovered andremoved. They had concealed a natural chasm which led under the rock.Tom got into this and held his candle as far under the rock as hecould but said he could not see to the end of the rift. He proposed toexplore. He stooped and passed under the narrow way descendedgradually. He followed its winding course first to the right then tothe left Huck at his heels. Tom turned a short curve byandby andexclaimedMy goodness Huck lookyhereIt was the treasurebox sure enough occupying a snug little cavernalong with an empty powderkeg a couple of guns in leather cases twoor three pairs of old moccasins a leather belt and some other rubbishwell soaked with the waterdrip.Got it at last said Huck ploughing among the tarnished coins withhis hand. My but were rich TomHuck I always reckoned wed get it. Its just too good to believebut we HAVE got it sure Say lets not fool around here. Lets snakeit out. Lemme see if I can lift the box.It weighed about fifty pounds. Tom could lift it after an awkwardfashion but could not carry it conveniently.I thought so he said THEY carried it like it was heavy that dayat the hanted house. I noticed that. I reckon I was right to think offetching the little bags along.The money was soon in the bags and the boys took it up to the crossrock.Now less fetch the guns and things said Huck.No Huck leave them there. Theyre just the tricks to have when wego to robbing. Well keep them there all the time and well hold ourorgies there too. Its an awful snug place for orgies.What orgiesI dono. But robbers always have orgies and of course weve got tohave them too. Come along Huck weve been in here a long time. Itsgetting late I reckon. Im hungry too. Well eat and smoke when weget to the skiff.They presently emerged into the clump of sumach bushes looked warilyout found the coast clear and were soon lunching and smoking in theskiff. As the sun dipped toward the horizon they pushed out and gotunder way. Tom skimmed up the shore through the long twilight chattingcheerily with Huck and landed shortly after dark.Now Huck said Tom well hide the money in the loft of thewidows woodshed and Ill come up in the morning and well count itand divide and then well hunt up a place out in the woods for itwhere it will be safe. Just you lay quiet here and watch the stuff tillI run and hook Benny Taylors little wagon I wont be gone a minute.He disappeared and presently returned with the wagon put the twosmall sacks into it threw some old rags on top of them and startedoff dragging his cargo behind him. When the boys reached theWelshmans house they stopped to rest. Just as they were about to moveon the Welshman stepped out and saidHallo whos thatHuck and Tom Sawyer.Good Come along with me boys you are keeping everybody waiting.Here hurry up trot ahead Ill haul the wagon for you. Why its notas light as it might be. Got bricks in it or old metalOld metal said Tom.I judged so the boys in this town will take more trouble and foolaway more time hunting up six bits worth of old iron to sell to thefoundry than they would to make twice the money at regular work. Butthats human nature hurry along hurry alongThe boys wanted to know what the hurry was about.Never mind youll see when we get to the Widow Douglas.Huck said with some apprehension for he was long used to beingfalsely accusedMr. Jones we havent been doing nothing.The Welshman laughed.Well I dont know Huck my boy. I dont know about that. Aint youand the widow good friendsYes. Well shes ben good friends to me anyway.All right then. What do you want to be afraid forThis question was not entirely answered in Hucks slow mind before hefound himself pushed along with Tom into Mrs. Douglas drawingroom.Mr. Jones left the wagon near the door and followed.The place was grandly lighted and everybody that was of anyconsequence in the village was there. The Thatchers were there theHarpers the Rogerses Aunt Polly Sid Mary the minister the editorand a great many more and all dressed in their best. The widowreceived the boys as heartily as any one could well receive two suchlooking beings. They were covered with clay and candlegrease. AuntPolly blushed crimson with humiliation and frowned and shook her headat Tom. Nobody suffered half as much as the two boys did however. Mr.Jones saidTom wasnt at home yet so I gave him up but I stumbled on him andHuck right at my door and so I just brought them along in a hurry.And you did just right said the widow. Come with me boys.She took them to a bedchamber and saidNow wash and dress yourselves. Here are two new suits of clothes shirts socks everything complete. Theyre Hucks no no thanksHuck Mr. Jones bought one and I the other. But theyll fit both of you.Get into them. Well wait come down when you are slicked up enough.Then she left.CHAPTER XXXIVHUCK said Tom we can slope if we can find a rope. The window ainthigh from the ground.Shucks what do you want to slope forWell I aint used to that kind of a crowd. I cant stand it. I aintgoing down there Tom.Oh bother It aint anything. I dont mind it a bit. Ill take careof you.Sid appeared.Tom said he auntie has been waiting for you all the afternoon.Mary got your Sunday clothes ready and everybodys been fretting aboutyou. Say aint this grease and clay on your clothesNow Mr. Siddy you jist tend to your own business. Whats all thisblowout about anywayIts one of the widows parties that shes always having. This timeits for the Welshman and his sons on account of that scrape theyhelped her out of the other night. And say I can tell you somethingif you want to know.Well whatWhy old Mr. Jones is going to try to spring something on the peoplehere tonight but I overheard him tell auntie today about it as asecret but I reckon its not much of a secret now. Everybody knows the widow too for all she tries to let on she dont. Mr. Jones wasbound Huck should be here couldnt get along with his grand secretwithout Huck you knowSecret about what SidAbout Huck tracking the robbers to the widows. I reckon Mr. Joneswas going to make a grand time over his surprise but I bet you it willdrop pretty flat.Sid chuckled in a very contented and satisfied way.Sid was it you that toldOh never mind who it was. SOMEBODY told thats enough.Sid theres only one person in this town mean enough to do that andthats you. If you had been in Hucks place youd a sneaked down thehill and never told anybody on the robbers. You cant do any but meanthings and you cant bear to see anybody praised for doing good ones.There no thanks as the widow says and Tom cuffed Sids ears andhelped him to the door with several kicks. Now go and tell auntie ifyou dare and tomorrow youll catch itSome minutes later the widows guests were at the suppertable and adozen children were propped up at little sidetables in the same roomafter the fashion of that country and that day. At the proper time Mr.Jones made his little speech in which he thanked the widow for thehonor she was doing himself and his sons but said that there wasanother person whose modesty And so forth and so on. He sprung his secret about Hucks share in theadventure in the finest dramatic manner he was master of but thesurprise it occasioned was largely counterfeit and not as clamorous andeffusive as it might have been under happier circumstances. Howeverthe widow made a pretty fair show of astonishment and heaped so manycompliments and so much gratitude upon Huck that he almost forgot thenearly intolerable discomfort of his new clothes in the entirelyintolerable discomfort of being set up as a target for everybodys gazeand everybodys laudations.The widow said she meant to give Huck a home under her roof and havehim educated and that when she could spare the money she would starthim in business in a modest way. Toms chance was come. He saidHuck dont need it. Hucks rich.Nothing but a heavy strain upon the good manners of the company keptback the due and proper complimentary laugh at this pleasant joke. Butthe silence was a little awkward. Tom broke itHucks got money. Maybe you dont believe it but hes got lots ofit. Oh you neednt smile I reckon I can show you. You just wait aminute.Tom ran out of doors. The company looked at each other with aperplexed interest and inquiringly at Huck who was tonguetied.Sid what ails Tom said Aunt Polly. He well there aint ever anymaking of that boy out. I never Tom entered struggling with the weight of his sacks and Aunt Pollydid not finish her sentence. Tom poured the mass of yellow coin uponthe table and saidThere what did I tell you Half of its Hucks and half of its mineThe spectacle took the general breath away. All gazed nobody spokefor a moment. Then there was a unanimous call for an explanation. Tomsaid he could furnish it and he did. The tale was long but brimful ofinterest. There was scarcely an interruption from any one to break thecharm of its flow. When he had finished Mr. Jones saidI thought I had fixed up a little surprise for this occasion but itdont amount to anything now. This one makes it sing mighty small Imwilling to allow.The money was counted. The sum amounted to a little over twelvethousand dollars. It was more than any one present had ever seen at onetime before though several persons were there who were worthconsiderably more than that in property.CHAPTER XXXVTHE reader may rest satisfied that Toms and Hucks windfall made amighty stir in the poor little village of St. Petersburg. So vast asum all in actual cash seemed next to incredible. It was talkedabout gloated over glorified until the reason of many of thecitizens tottered under the strain of the unhealthy excitement. Everyhaunted house in St. Petersburg and the neighboring villages wasdissected plank by plank and its foundations dug up and ransacked forhidden treasure and not by boys but men pretty grave unromanticmen too some of them. Wherever Tom and Huck appeared they werecourted admired stared at. The boys were not able to remember thattheir remarks had possessed weight before but now their sayings weretreasured and repeated everything they did seemed somehow to beregarded as remarkable they had evidently lost the power of doing andsaying commonplace things moreover their past history was raked upand discovered to bear marks of conspicuous originality. The villagepaper published biographical sketches of the boys.The Widow Douglas put Hucks money out at six per cent. and JudgeThatcher did the same with Toms at Aunt Pollys request. Each lad hadan income now that was simply prodigious a dollar for every weekdayin the year and half of the Sundays. It was just what the minister got no it was what he was promised he generally couldnt collect it. Adollar and a quarter a week would board lodge and school a boy inthose old simple days and clothe him and wash him too for thatmatter.Judge Thatcher had conceived a great opinion of Tom. He said that nocommonplace boy would ever have got his daughter out of the cave. WhenBecky told her father in strict confidence how Tom had taken herwhipping at school the Judge was visibly moved and when she pleadedgrace for the mighty lie which Tom had told in order to shift thatwhipping from her shoulders to his own the Judge said with a fineoutburst that it was a noble a generous a magnanimous lie a lie thatwas worthy to hold up its head and march down through history breast tobreast with George Washingtons lauded Truth about the hatchet Beckythought her father had never looked so tall and so superb as when hewalked the floor and stamped his foot and said that. She went straightoff and told Tom about it.Judge Thatcher hoped to see Tom a great lawyer or a great soldier someday. He said he meant to look to it that Tom should be admitted to theNational Military Academy and afterward trained in the best law schoolin the country in order that he might be ready for either career orboth.Huck Finns wealth and the fact that he was now under the WidowDouglas protection introduced him into society no dragged him intoit hurled him into it and his sufferings were almost more than hecould bear. The widows servants kept him clean and neat combed andbrushed and they bedded him nightly in unsympathetic sheets that hadnot one little spot or stain which he could press to his heart and knowfor a friend. He had to eat with a knife and fork he had to usenapkin cup and plate he had to learn his book he had to go tochurch he had to talk so properly that speech was become insipid inhis mouth whithersoever he turned the bars and shackles ofcivilization shut him in and bound him hand and foot.He bravely bore his miseries three weeks and then one day turned upmissing. For fortyeight hours the widow hunted for him everywhere ingreat distress. The public were profoundly concerned they searchedhigh and low they dragged the river for his body. Early the thirdmorning Tom Sawyer wisely went poking among some old empty hogsheadsdown behind the abandoned slaughterhouse and in one of them he foundthe refugee. Huck had slept there he had just breakfasted upon somestolen odds and ends of food and was lying off now in comfort withhis pipe. He was unkempt uncombed and clad in the same old ruin ofrags that had made him picturesque in the days when he was free andhappy. Tom routed him out told him the trouble he had been causingand urged him to go home. Hucks face lost its tranquil content andtook a melancholy cast. He saidDont talk about it Tom. Ive tried it and it dont work it dontwork Tom. It aint for me I aint used to it. The widders good tome and friendly but I cant stand them ways. She makes me get up justat the same time every morning she makes me wash they comb me all tothunder she wont let me sleep in the woodshed I got to wear themblamed clothes that just smothers me Tom they dont seem to any airgit through em somehow and theyre so rotten nice that I cant setdown nor lay down nor roll around anywhers I haint slid on acellardoor for well it pears to be years I got to go to church andsweat and sweat I hate them ornery sermons I cant ketch a fly inthere I cant chaw. I got to wear shoes all Sunday. The widder eats bya bell she goes to bed by a bell she gits up by a bell everythingsso awful reglar a body cant stand it.Well everybody does that way Huck.Tom it dont make no difference. I aint everybody and I cantSTAND it. Its awful to be tied up so. And grub comes too easy I donttake no interest in vittles that way. I got to ask to go afishing Igot to ask to go in aswimming dernd if I haint got to ask to doeverything. Well Id got to talk so nice it wasnt no comfort Id gotto go up in the attic and rip out awhile every day to git a taste inmy mouth or Id a died Tom. The widder wouldnt let me smoke shewouldnt let me yell she wouldnt let me gape nor stretch norscratch before folks Then with a spasm of special irritation andinjury And dad fetch it she prayed all the time I never see such awoman I HAD to shove Tom I just had to. And besides that schoolsgoing to open and Id a had to go to it well I wouldnt stand THATTom. Looky here Tom being rich aint what its cracked up to be. Itsjust worry and worry and sweat and sweat and awishing you was deadall the time. Now these clothes suits me and this barl suits me andI aint ever going to shake em any more. Tom I wouldnt ever got intoall this trouble if it hadnt a ben for that money now you just takemy sheer of it along with yourn and gimme a tencenter sometimes notmany times becuz I dont give a dern for a thing thout its tollablehard to git and you go and beg off for me with the widder.Oh Huck you know I cant do that. Taint fair and besides ifyoull try this thing just a while longer youll come to like it.Like it Yes the way Id like a hot stove if I was to set on it longenough. No Tom I wont be rich and I wont live in them cussedsmothery houses. I like the woods and the river and hogsheads andIll stick to em too. Blame it all just as wed got guns and acave and all just fixed to rob here this dern foolishness has got tocome up and spile it allTom saw his opportunity Lookyhere Huck being rich aint going to keep me back from turningrobber.No Oh goodlicks are you in real deadwood earnest TomJust as dead earnest as Im sitting here. But Huck we cant let youinto the gang if you aint respectable you know.Hucks joy was quenched.Cant let me in Tom Didnt you let me go for a pirateYes but thats different. A robber is more hightoned than what apirate is as a general thing. In most countries theyre awful high upin the nobility dukes and such.Now Tom haint you always ben friendly to me You wouldnt shet meout would you Tom You wouldnt do that now WOULD you TomHuck I wouldnt want to and I DONT want to but what would peoplesay Why theyd say Mph Tom Sawyers Gang pretty low characters init Theyd mean you Huck. You wouldnt like that and I wouldnt.Huck was silent for some time engaged in a mental struggle. Finallyhe saidWell Ill go back to the widder for a month and tackle it and see ifI can come to stand it if youll let me blong to the gang Tom.All right Huck its a whiz Come along old chap and Ill ask thewidow to let up on you a little Huck.Will you Tom now will you Thats good. If shell let up on some ofthe roughest things Ill smoke private and cuss private and crowdthrough or bust. When you going to start the gang and turn robbersOh right off. Well get the boys together and have the initiationtonight maybe.Have the whichHave the initiation.Whats thatIts to swear to stand by one another and never tell the gangssecrets even if youre chopped all to flinders and kill anybody andall his family that hurts one of the gang.Thats gay thats mighty gay Tom I tell you.Well I bet it is. And all that swearings got to be done atmidnight in the lonesomest awfulest place you can find a hantedhouse is the best but theyre all ripped up now.Well midnights good anyway Tom.Yes so it is. And youve got to swear on a coffin and sign it withblood.Now thats something LIKE Why its a million times bullier thanpirating. Ill stick to the widder till I rot Tom and if I git to bea reglar ripper of a robber and everybody talking bout it I reckonshell be proud she snaked me in out of the wet.CONCLUSIONSO endeth this chronicle. It being strictly a history of a BOY itmust stop here the story could not go much further without becomingthe history of a MAN. When one writes a novel about grown people heknows exactly where to stop that is with a marriage but when hewrites of juveniles he must stop where he best can.Most of the characters that perform in this book still live and areprosperous and happy. Some day it may seem worth while to take up thestory of the younger ones again and see what sort of men and women theyturned out to be therefore it will be wisest not to reveal any of thatpart of their lives at present.End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer Completeby Mark Twain Samuel Clemens END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK TOM SAWYER This file should be named .txt or .zip This and all associated files of various formats will be found in httpwww.gutenberg.netProduced by David Widger.

She didnt react. Just gestured that I remove my shoes and take the couch. She had an office like any other doctors minus the smells and cold dangerous instruments. She waited for me to talk more. I hesitated and spoke again. Im sure people come here with big insurmountable problems. Girlfriends dump their boyfriends everyday. Hardly the reason to see a shrink right What am I a psycho No I am the psycho. Psychotherapist to be precise. If you dont mind I prefer that to shrink she said. Sorry I said. Its OK she said and reclined on her chair. No more than thirty she seemed young for a shrink sorry psychotherapist. Certificates from top US universities adorned the walls like tiger heads in a hunters home. Yes another South Indian had conquered the world of academics. Dr. Neeta Iyer Valedictorian Vassar College. I charge five hundred rupees per hour she said. Stare at the walls or talk. Im cool either way. I had spent twelve minutes or a hundred bucks without getting anywhere. I wondered if she would accept a partial payment and let me leave. Dr. Iyer Neeta is fine she said. OK Neeta I dont think my problem warrants this. I dont know why Dr. Ramachandran sent me here. She picked my file from her desk. Lets see. This is Dr. Rams brief to me patient has sleep deprivation has cut off human contact for a week refuses to eat has Googlesearched on best ways to commit suicide. She paused and looked at me with raised eyebrows. I Google for all sorts of stuff I mumbled dont you The report says the mere mention of her name her neighbourhood or any association like her favourite dish brings out unpredictable emotions ranging from tears to rage to frustration. I had a breakup. What do you expect I was irritated. Sure with Ananya who stays in Mylapore. Whats her favourite dish Curd rice I sat up straight. Dont I said weakly and felt a lump in my throat. I fought back tears. Dont I said again. Dont what Neeta egged me on Minor problem isnt it Fuck minor. Its killing me. I stood agitatedly. Do you South Indians even know what emotions are all about Ill ignore the racist comment. You can stand and talk but if it is a long story take the couch. I want it all she said. I broke into tears. Why did this happen to me I sobbed. DX www.desibbrg.com She passed me a tissue. Where do I begin I said and sat gingerly on the couch. Where all love stories begin. From when you met her the first time she said. She drew the curtains and switched on the airconditioner. I began to talk and get my moneys worth. DX www.desibbrg.com ACT Ahmedabad DX www.desibbrg.com She stood two places ahead of me in the lunch line at the IIMA mess. I checked her out from the corner of my eye wondering what the big fuss about this South Indian girl was. Her waistlength hair rippled as she tapped the steel plate with her fingers like a famished refugee. I noticed three black threads on the back of her fair neck. Someone had decided to accessorize in the most academicallyoriented Bschool in the country. Ananya Swaminathan best girl in the fresher batch seniors has already anointed her on the dorm board. We had only twenty girls in a batch of two hundred. Goodlooking ones were rare girls dont get selected to IIM for their looks. They get in because they can solve mathematical problems faster than . of Indias population and crack the CAT. Most IIM girls are above shallow things like makeup fitting clothes contact lenses removal of facial hair body odour and feminine charm. Girls like Ananya if and when they arrive by freak chance become instant pinups in out testosteronecharged estrogenstarved campus. I imagined Ms Swaminathan had received more male attention in the last week than she had in her entire life. Thus I assumed shed be obnoxious and decided to ignore her. The students inched forward on autopilot. The bored kitchen staff couldnt care if they were serving prisoners or future CEOs. They tossed one ladle of yellow stuff after another into plates. Of course Ms Best Girl needed the spotlight. Thats not rasam. Whatever it is its definitely not rasam. And whats that the dark yellow stuff Sambhar the mess worker growled. Eew looks disgusting How did you make it she asked. You want or not the mess worker said more interested in wrapping up lunch than discussing recipes. While our lady decided the two boys between us banged their plates on the counter. They took the food without editorials about it and left. I came up right behind her. I stole a sideways glance definitely above average. Actually well above average. In fact outlier by IIMA standards. She had perfect features with eyes nose lips and ears the right size and in the right places. That is all it takes to make people beautiful normal body parts yet why does nature mess is up so many times Her tiny blue bindi matched her sky blue and white slawar kameez. She looked like Sridevis smarter cousin if there is such a possibility. The mess worker dumped a yellow lump on my plate. DX www.desibbrg.com Excuse me Im before him she said to the mess worker pinning him down with her large confident eyes. What you want the mess worker said in a heavy South Indian accent. You calling rasam not rasam. You make face when you see my sambhar. I feed hundred people. They no complain. And that is why you dont improve. Maybe they should complain she said. The mess worker dropped the ladle in the sambhar vessel and threw up his hands. You want complain Go to mess manager and complain....see what student coming to these days the mess worker turned to me seeking sympathy. I almost nodded. She looked at me. Can you eat this stuff she wanted to know. Try it. I took a spoonful of sambhar. Warm and salty not gourmet stuff but edible in a nochoice kind of way. I could eat it for lunch I had stayed in a hostel for four years. However I saw her face now prettier with a hint of pink. I compared her to the fiftyyear old mess worker. He wore a lungi and had visible grey hair on his chest. When in doubt the pretty girl is always right. Its disgusting I said. See she said with childlike glee. The mess worker glared at me. But I can develop a taste for it I added in a lame attempt to soothe him. The mess worker grunted and tossed a mound of rice on my plate. Pick something you like I said to her avoiding eye contact. The whole campus had stared at her in the past few days. I had to appear different. Give me the rasgullas she pointed to the dessert. That is after you finish meal the mess worker said. Who are you My Mother I am finished. Give me two rasgullas she insisted. Only one per student he said as he placed a katori with one sweet on her plate. Oh come on there are no limits on this disgusting sambhar but only one of what is edible she said. The line grew behind us. The boys in line didnt mind. They had a chance to legitimately stare at the bestlooking girl of the batch. Give mine to her I said and regretted it immediately. Shell never date you it is a rasgulla down the drain I scolded myself. I give to you the mess worker said virtuously as he placed the dessert on my DX www.desibbrg.com plate. I passed my katori to her. She took the two rasgullas and moved out of the line. OK buddy pretty girl goes her way rasgullaless loser goes another. Find a corner to sit I said to myself. She turned to me. She didnt ask me to sit with her but she looked like she wouldnt mind if I did. She pointed to a table with a little finger where we sat down opposite each other. The entire mess stared at us wondering what I had done to merit sitting with her. I have made a huge sacrifice my dessert I wanted to tell them. Im Krish I said doodling in the sambhar with my spoon. Im Ananya. Yuk isnt it she said as I grimaced at the foods taste. Im used to hostel food I shrugged. Ive had worse. Hard to imagine worse she said. I coughed as I bit on a green chili. She had a water jug next to her. She lifted the jug leaned forward and poured water for me. A collective sigh ran through the mess. We had become everyones matinee show. She finished her two desserts in four bites. Im still hungry. I didnt even have breakfast. Hunger or tasteless food hostel life is about whatever is easier to deal with I said. You want to go out Im sure the city has decent restaurants she said. Now We had a class in one hour. But Ms Best Girl had asked me out even though for her own stomach. And as everyone knows female classmates always come before class. Dont tell me you are dying to attend the lecture she said and stood up daring me. I spooned in some rice. She stamped her foot. Leave that disgusting stuff. Four hundred eyes followed us as I walked out of the mess with Ms Ananya Swaminathan rated the best girl by popular vote in IIMA. Do you like chicken The menu rested on her nose as she spoke. We had DX www.desibbrg.com come to Topaz a basic soulless but airconditioned restaurant half a kilometer from campus. Like all midrange Indian restaurants it played boring instrumental versions of old Hindi songs and served little marinated onions on the table. I thought Ahmedabad was vegetarian I said. Please Id die here then. She turned to the waiter and ordered half a tandoori chicken with roomali rotis. Do you have beer she asked the waiter. The waiter shook his head in horror and left. We are in Gujarat there is prohibition here I said. Why Gandhijis birthplace I said But Gandhiji won us freedom she said playing with the little onions. Whats the point of getting people free only to put restrictions on them Point I said. So you are an expert on rasam and sambhar. Are you a South Indian Tamilian please be precise. In fact Tamil Brahmin which is way different from Tamilians. Never forget that. She leaned back as the waiter served our meal. She tore a chicken leg with her teeth. And how exactly are Tamil Brahmins different Well for one thing no meat and no drinking she said as she gestured a cross with t he chicken leg. Absolutely I said. She laughed. I didnt say I am a practising Tam Brahm. But you should know that I am born into the purest of pure upper caste communities ever created. What about you commoner I am a Punjabi though I never lived in Punjab. I grew up in Delhi. And I have no idea about my caste but we do eat chicken. And I can digest bad sambhar better than Tamil Brahmins I said. You are funny she said tapping my hand. I liked the tap. So where did you stay in hostel before she said. Please dont say IIT you are doing pretty well so far. Whats wrong with IIT Nothing are you from there She sipped water. Yes from IIT Delhi. Is that a problem No she smiled not yet. DX www.desibbrg.com Excuse me I said. Her smugness had reached irritating levels. Nothing she said. We stayed quiet. Whats the deal Someone from IIT broke your heart She laughed. No on the contrary. I seem to have broken some for no fault of my own. Care to explain Dont tell anyone but in the past one week that Ive been here Ive had ten proposals. All from IITians. I mentally kicked myself. My guess was right she was getting a lot of attention. I only wished it wasnt from my own people. Proposals for what The usual to go out be friends and stuff. Oh and one guy from IIT Chennai proposed marriage Serious Yes he said this past week has been momentous for him. He joined IIMA and now he has found his wife in me. I may be wrong but I think he had some jewellery on him. I smacked my forehead. No my collegemates cant be doing this whatever the deprivation. So you understand my concern about you being from IIT she said picking up a chicken breast next. Oh so it is a natural reaction. If I am from IIT I have to propose to you within ten minutes I didnt say that. You implied that. Im sorry. Its OK. I expected you to be like this. Let me guess only child rich parents Wrong wrong. I have a younger brother. And my father works in Bank of Baroda in Chennai. Sorry you expected me to be like what Some girls cannot handle attention. Two days of popularity and every guy in college should bow to you. Thats not true. Didnt I come out with you She neatly transferred the bare bones of the chicken on to another plate. DX www.desibbrg.com Oh thats huge. Coming out with a commoner like me. How much is the bill Ill pay my share and leave. I stood up. Hey she said. What Im sorry. Please sit down. I had lost interest in the conversation anyway. If there is nothing as attractive as a pretty girl theres nothing as repulsive as a cocky chick. I sat back and focused on the food and the irritating instrumental music for the next ten minutes. I ignored the Brahmin who stereotyped my collegemates. Are we OK now she smiled hesitantly. Why did you come out with me To take your score to eleven You really want to know Yes. I need some friends here. And you seemed like a safezone guy. Like the kind of guy who could just be friends with a girl right Absolutely not I thought. Why would any guy want to be only friends with a girl Its like agreeing to be near a chocolate cake and never eat it. Its like sitting in a racing car but not driving it. Only wimps do that. Im not so sure I said. You can handle it. I told you about the proposals because you can see how stupid they are. They are not stupid. They are IITians. They just dont know how to talk to women yet I said. Whatever. But you do. And Id like to be friends with you. Just friends OK She extended her hand. I gave her a limp handshake. Lets share sixty each she said as the bill arrived. Thats right just friends share bills. I didnt want to be just friends with her. And I didnt want to be the eleventh martyr. I paid my share and came back to campus. I had no interest in meeting my just friend anytime again soon. DX www.desibbrg.com You OK I said going up to my just friend. She remained in her seat as her tears reemerged. The last lecture had ended and the classroom was empty. I hadnt spoken much to Ananya after our lunch last week. Pretty girls behave best when you ignore them. Of course they have to know you are ignoring them for otherwise they may not even know you exist. But today I had to talk to her. She had cried in the class. We had auditoriumstyle classrooms with semicircular rows so everyone could see everyone. Students sat in alphabetical order. Ananya like all kids doomed with names starting with the letter A sat in the first row on the left side. She sat between Ankur and Aditya both IITians who had already proposed to her without considering the embarrassment of being rejected and then sitting next to the rejection for the whole year. I sat in the third row between Kanyashree who took notes like a diligent court transcripter and five Mohits who had come from different parts of India. But neither Ankur nor Kanyashree nor the five Mohits had noticed Ananyas tears. Only I had caught her wiping her eye with a yellow dupatta that had little bells at its ends that tinkled whenever she moved. In the past week I had limited my communication with Ananya to cursory greetings every morning and a casual wave at the end of the day. During classes we had to pay attention to the teachers we had marks for class participation saying something that sounds intelligent. Most IITians never spoke while people from nonscience backgrounds spoke nonstop. Twentythree minutes into the microeconomics class the professor drew an Lshaped utility curve on the blackboard. He admired his curve for ten seconds and then turned to the class. How many economics graduates here asked Prof Chatterjee a twodecade IIMA veteran. Fifteen students out of the seventy students in section A raised their hands Ananya included. Chatterjee turned to her. You recognise the curve Ms Swaminathan He read her name from the nameplate in front. The basic marginal utility curve sir Ananya said. So Ms Swaminathan how would you represent that curve mathematically Ananya stood up her eyes explaining clearly that she had no clue. The remaining fourteen economics graduates lowered their hands. Yes Ms Swaminathan Chatterjee said. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya clutched the trinkets on her dupatta so they didnt make a noise as she spoke. Sir that curve shows different bundles of goods between which a consumer is indifferent. That is at each point on the curve the consumer has equal preference for one bundle over another. Thats not my question. What is the mathematical formula I dont know that. In any case this is only a concept. But do you know it No. but I cant think of any real life situation where a mathematical formula like this would work Ananya said. Prof raised his hand to interrupt her. Shsh. He gave a sinister smile. Notice class notice. This is the state of economics education in our country. Top graduates dont know the basics. And then they ask why is India economically backward Prof emphatically dropped the chalk on his table to conclude his point. He had solved what had dumbfounded policymakers for decades. Ananya Swaminathan was the reason for Indias backwardness. Ananya hung her head in shame. A few IITians brightened up. Microeconomics was an elective course in IIT and those who had done it knew the formula. They were itching to show off. Anyone knows Prof asked and Ankur raised his hand. Yes tell us. Ms Swaminathan you should talk to your neighbours more. And next time dont raise your hand if I ask for microeconomics graduates. Prof said. He went to the board to write lots of Greek symbols and calculus equations. The course started with cute little things like how many people choose between tea and biscuits. It had moved on to scary equations that would dominate exams. The class took mad notes. Kanyashree wrote so hard I could feel the seismic vibrations from her pens nib. I stole a glance at Ananya. As a smug Ankur saw his words inscribed on the board Ananyas left hands fingers scrunched up her yellow dupatta. She moved her left hand to her face even as she continued to write with her right. In subtle movements she dabbed at her tears. Maybe Ms Best Girl had a heart I thought. And maybe I should cut out my studied ignorance strategy and talk to her after class. You OK I said again. She nodded while continuing to wipe her tears. She fixed her gaze down. I miss Topaz I said to change the topic. Ive never been so humiliated she said. Nobody cares. All professors are assholes. Thats the universal truth I DX www.desibbrg.com offered. At least where I come from. You want to see my economics degree Ill show you my grades. No I said. I came third in the entire Delhi University. These wannabe engineer profs have turned economics from perfectly fine liberal arts subject to this Greek symbol junkyard she said as she pointed to the formulae on the board. I kept silent. You are from IIT. You probably love these equations she said and looked up at me. Despite her tears she still looked pretty. I looked at the blackboard. Yes I did have a fondness for algebra. Its nothing to be ashamed of. Yet this wasnt the time. No I am not a big fan. Greek symbols do take the fun out of any subject. Exactly but these profs dont think so. They will have these equations in the test next week. I am going to flunk. And he is going to turn me into this specimen of the educated but clueless Indian student. I bet I am the staffroom discussion right now. They are all frustrated I said. we are half their age but will earn twice as them in two years. Wouldnt you hate an elevenyearold if he earned double She smiled. You need to hang that dupatta out to dry I said. She smiled some more. We walked out of the class. We decided to skip lunch and have tea and omelette at the roadside Rambhai outside campus. He is going to screw me in microeconomics. Hes probably circled my name and put a D in front of it already she said nestling the hot glass of tea in her dupatta folds for insulation. Dont freak out. Listen you can study with me. I dont like these equations but I am good at them. Thats all we did at IIT for four years. She looked at me for a few seconds. Hey I have no interest in being number eleven. This is purely for study reasons. DX www.desibbrg.com She laughed. Actually the score is thirteen now. IITians No this time form NIT. They are catching up. I know we are losing our edge. Whatever I dont want to be number fourteen. I thought I could teach you.. She interrupted me I cant learn economics from you. I am a university topper in economics. You are an engineer. Then good luck I said and stood up to pay. I didnt say that. I said you cant teach me. But we can study together. I looked at her. She looked nice and I couldnt blame the thirteen guys for trying. My room at eight Ever been to the girls dorm There is a first time for everything I said. Cool carry lots of books to make it clear what you are there for Ananya advised. DX www.desibbrg.com I reached the girls dorm at p.m. I carried the weeks case materials the size of six telephone directories. I knocked at her door. One second I am changing her muffled scream came from inside. After three hundred seconds she opened the door. She wore a red and white tracksuit. Sorry she said as she tied up her hair in a bun. Come in. Wed better start there is so much to do. She gave me her study chair and sat on her bed. The rustcoloured bedsheet matched the exposed brick walls. She had made a notice board out of chart paper and stuck family pictures all over. See thats my family. Thats my dad. He is so cute she said. I looked carefully. A middleaged man with neatly combed hair rationed his grin. He wore a halfsleeve shirt with a dhoti in most of the pictures. He looked like the neighbor who stops you from playing loud music. No nothing cute about him. I scanned the remaining pictures taken on festivals weddings and birthdays. In one Ananyas whole family stood to attention at the beach. You could almost hear the national anthem. Thats Marina Beach in Chennai. Do you know it is the second largest city beach in the world I saw her brother around fourteen years of age. The oiled hair geeky face and spectacles made him look like an IITian embryo. His lack of interest in the world expression told me he would make it. And thats mom I quizzed. Ananya nodded. Ananyas brother and father still seemed mild compared to her mother. Even in pictures she had a glum expression that made you wonder what did you do wrong. She reminded me of the strictest teachers I ever had in school. I immediately felt guilty about being in her daughters room. My hands tingled as I almost expected her to jump out of the picture and slap me with a ruler. Mom and I Ananya said as she kneeled on the bed and sighed. DX www.desibbrg.com What I looked at a wedding picture of her relatives. Given the dusky complexion everyones teeth shone extra white. All old women wore as much gold as their bodies could carry and silk saris shiny as road reflectors. Nothing I wish I got along better with her Ananya said. Hey you have pictures of your family I shook my head. My family was too disorganized to ever pause and pose at the right moment. I dont think we even had a camera. Who is there in your family She sifted through the case materials to take out the economics notes. Mom dad and me. Thats it I said. Tell me more. What do they do Who are you close to We met to study I pointed out and pated the microeconomics booklet. Of course we will. I only asked to make conversation. Dont tell me if you dont want to she said and batted her eyelids. How can such scary looking parents create something so cute OK Ill answer. But after that we study. No gossip for an hour I warned. Sure I already have my book open she said and sat on the bed crosslegged. OK my mother is a housewife. I am close to her but not hugely close. That reminds me I have to call her. Ill go to the STD booth later. And dad I am super close to mine. Lets study I said and opened the books. You arent close to your father You want to flunk Shsh she agreed and covered her lips with a finger. We studied for the next two hours in silence. She would look up sometimes and do pointless things like changing her pillow cover or readjusting her study lamp. I ignored all that. I had wasted enough of my initial years at IIT. Most likely due to a CAT computation error I had another chance at IIMA. I wanted to make it count. Wow you can really concentrate she said after an hour. its ten. STD calls are cheap now. DX www.desibbrg.com Oh yes I better go I said. Ill come with you. Ill call home too she said and skipped off the bed to wear her slippers. Seri seri seri Amma..Seri she said each seri increasing in pitch volume and frustration. She had called home. Many students had lined up to make cheap calls at the STD booth a fiveminute walk from campus. Most carried their microeconomics notes. I helped Ananya with small change after her call. Is he dating her I overheard a student whisper to another. I dont think so she treats him like a brother his friend guffawed. I ignored the comment and went into the booth. Every girl wants an IIT brother big help in quant subjects the first student said as several people around them laughed. I controlled my urge to snap back at them and dialed home. Hello my fathers voice came after four rings. I kept silent. The meter started to click. Hello Hello my father continued to speak. I kept the phone down. The printer churned out the bill. Missed connection you have to pay the shopkeeper said. I nodded and dialed again. This time my mother picked up. Mom I screamed. I told you to be near the phone after ten. Im sorry. I was in the kitchen. He wanted to talk to you so he picked up. Say hello to him first and then ask him for me. DX www.desibbrg.com Im not interested. OK leave that. How are you doing How is the place Its fine. But they make you cram even more than in the previous college. How is the food Terrible. I am in a hostel. What do you expect Im going to send some pickle. The city has good restaurants. They have chicken she asked her voice worried as if she had asked about basic amenities like power and water. In a few places. FMS was good enough. I dont know why you had to leave Delhi. Mom I am not going to make my career choices based on the availability of chicken I said and looked at the meter. I had spent eighteen bucks. Ill hang up now. Tell me something more no. did you make any friends Not really sort of. I looked at Ananyas face outside the booth. She looked at me and smiled. Who Whats their name AnAnant. Punjabi Mom Im sorry. I just thought you could have a friend who likes the same food. Its OK. We are very modern. Dont you know Yeah right. Ill catch you later. I have a test tomorrow. Oh really Pray before the exam OK Sure let me finish studying first. I hung up and paid twentyfive bucks. DX www.desibbrg.com Why did you hang up the first time Your dad picked right Ananya asked as we walked back. I stopped in my tracks. How do you know I guessed. I do it with mom when Im angry with her. We dont hang up we just stay on the line and keep silent. And pay Yes. Pretty expensive way to let each other know we are upset. Only sometimes though. I never speak to my father I said. Why Ananya looked at me. Long story. Not for tonight. Or any night. Id like to keep it to myself. Sure she said. We walked for a moment in silence before she spoke again. So your parents have big expectations from you Which job are you going to take Finance Marketing IT Neither of those I said. Though i will take up a job for the money first. So what do you want to be Like really She looked right into my eyes. I couldnt lie. I want to be a writer I said. I expected her to flip out and laugh. But she didnt. She nodded and continued to walk. What kind of writer she said. Someone who tells stories that are fun but bring about change too. The pens mightier than the sword one of the first proverbs we learnt isnt it She nodded. Sounds ridiculous No not really she said. How about you What do you want to be She laughed. Well I dont know. My mother already feels Im too ambitious and independent. So I am trying not to think too far. As of now I just want to do DX www.desibbrg.com OK in my quiz and make my mother happy. Both are incredibly difficult though she said. We reached her room and practised numerical for the next two hours. I am so glad you are here. Id never be able to crack these she said after I solved a tricky one for her. You are not using me are you Excuse me Like you are friends with me because I am from IIT So I can help you with the quant subjects. Are you kidding me she looked shocked. I dont want to be the IIT brother I said. What Whatever that is you are not. We are friends right She extended her hand. I looked into her eyes. No those eyes couldnt use anyone. Good night I said and shook her hand. Hey Krish she said as I turned to leave. What The stuff you said about being a writer who brings about change. It is really cool. I mean it she said. I smiled. Good night she said and shut her door. A few sleepless girls wandered in the dorm with their notes. They gave me suspicious looks. I only came to study I said and walked out of the dorm fast. I dont know why I felt the need to give an explanation. DX www.desibbrg.com She came out of the research assistants room with her microeconomics quiz results. She walked past the queued up students toward me. By this time everyone on campus knew of her friendship or as someone would say siblingship with me. She wore denim shorts and a pink Tshirt drawing extra long glances from the boys from engineering colleges. Bplus people say it is a good grade she said holding up her answer sheet. Your shorts are too short I said. Show me your grade she said snatching my paper. A minus wow you cracked an Aminus I didnt react. We walked back towards our dorms. You cannot score more than me in economics I dont believe this she said. You are a mechanical engineer. I am a university gold medalist in the subject. Show the medal to Prof Chatterjee I said in a serious tone. Hey you OK I kept quiet. Anyway I owe you a treat. Your numerical saved me. Are you hungry I nodded. People who live in hostels are always hungry. Lets go to Rambhai she said. You are not coming to Rambhai like this I said. Like what Like in these shorts I said. Excuse me. Is it a Delhi thing or a Punjabi thing Controlling what women wear It is a common sense thing. It is outside campus. People stare I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Enough people stare within campus. Im fine lets go she said and walked towards the campus gates. I dont need a treat. Its fine I said turning in the opposite direction towards my dorm. Are you serious You are not coming she called from behind. I shook my head. Up to you. I ignored her and continued to walk. Are you going to come for the study session tonight I shrugged to signify whatever. Any dress code for me she said. You are not my girlfriend. Wear whatever. What do I care I said. We didnt talk about the afternoon episode when I came to her room in the evening. She had changed into black track pants and an oversized fullsleeve black Tshirt. She was covered up enough to go for a walk in Afghanistan. I kind of missed her shorts but I had brought it upon myself. I opened the marketing case that we had to prepare for the next day. Nirdosh nicotinefreecigarettes I read out the title. Who the fuck wants that I feel like a real smoke she said. I gave her a dirty look. What Am I not allowed to use the F words Or is it that I expressed a desire to smoke What are you trying to prove DX www.desibbrg.com Nothing. I want you to consider the possibility that women are intelligent human beings. And intelligent people dont like to be told what to wear or do especially when they are adults. Does that make any sense to you Dont be oversmart I said. Dont patronize me she said. There are other ways to attract attention than by wearing less clothes I said. I didnt do it to attract attention. I wear shorts because I like to wear shorts. Can we study I opened the case again. We kept quiet for half an hour and immersed ourselves in our books. I wasnt trying to attract attention she said again looking up from her books. It doesnt matter to me I said. Are you jealous Are you kidding me I slammed my book shut. No just checking. Lets study. She turned back to her books a smile on her face. I threw the pillow at her. She laughed and slammed it on my head. I realised this was the first contact sport I had played with her apart from shaking hands. DX www.desibbrg.com We studied together every day for the next month. Even though I pretended to be fine with the just friends thing it was killing me. Every time I looked up from my books I saw her face. Every time I saw her I wanted to grab her face and kiss her. The only way I could focus was by imagining that Prof Chatterjee was in our room. Even outside the study sessions it wasnt easy. Every time I saw a guy talk to her or laugh with her a hot flush started from my stomach and reached my face. Sometimes she would tell me how funny some guy in section A was or how cute some guy in section B was and I wanted to go with a machine gun and shoot the respective guys in sections A and B. What They should go full on with the advertising campaign right she referred to the marketing case. I had been staring at her lips researching ways of kissing her. Huh Yes I agree with you I said. Your mind is elsewhere. What are you thinking of right now she snapped her fingers. Nothing sorry I was thinking how..how insightful you are in marketing. Thank you she smiled believing me. Yes I like this subject. I think I will be good at a marketing job. So I will go with this recommendation tomorrow. We finished the case at midnight. I stood up to leave. Tea she said suggesting we go to Rambhai. No. I cant fall asleep then I said. Maggi I will make it in the pantry upstairs. No Id better go She came to the door with me. You are so serious these days. What do you keep thinking about Grades I cant study with you any longer I blurted out. DX www.desibbrg.com What she said surprised. Weve figured out a rhythm for ourselves. We dont need to study together anymore. Yeah but we like to study together at least I do.Whats up Did I do anything wrong Its not you. Its me I said. Dont do an its not you its me on me Ananya screamed. Her loud voice woke up a girl in the next room who switched on her light. We are not dating OK Stop behaving like we are having a breakup I whispered. And go to sleep. Theres a quiz tomorrow. I didnt speak to her in the class the next day. She came up to me twice once to return my pen that I had left in her room and another time during the midmorning break to ask me if I wanted to go for tea. Once you start liking someone their mere presence evokes a warm feeling in you. I fought the feeling before it took control of me. Id rather read up for the next class. You go have tea I said. She didnt insist as she left the room. She had worn a long maroon skirt and a light brown top. I wish shed turn back and look at me. But she didnt. she joined her dormmates and went out for tea. I dodged her for the next five days. I came late to class and left first so there was no time for greetings. You are not talking to her the Mohit right next to me asked while the other four craned their necks to listen. Even Kanyashree paused from her frantic notetaking and turned her profile tendegrees towards me. You seem quite concerned I said and everyone promptly backed off. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya knocked at my door at nine in the night. I had just sat down to study after dinner. Girls rarely visited boys dorms. She had come to my room only once before. It had excited my dormmates into an impromptu Frisbee match set to loud music in the dorm corridor. She reminds me of Bhagyashree one of the boys had screamed outside our room. Even I couldnt resist a smile. He went on to play a song from Maine Pyar Kiya that urged a pigeon to play postman. Thats it. We are never studying at your dorm again she had fumed as she packed her books. She opened the door to eight boys playing Frisbee in the corridor. For the record I Hate Bhagyashree she had said and stormed off. But here she was again. And the firmness in her step meant my dormmates didnt act like Neanderthals and had disappeared into their rooms. I opened the door. She stood there wearing the blue and white salwar kameez that she wore the first time I saw her. When you are in campus you can figure out a pattern in peoples clothes. Her blue salwar kameez repeated itself every three weeks. She had brought two Frootis with her. Can I come in Can I distract the scholar for ten minutes from his studies Unlike her room there was no aesthetic appeal to mine. I had left the red bricks bare and they looked like prison walls. My originally white bedsheet had turned grey after being washed in acid in the IIT hostels. My desk only had books unlike Ananyas who always had cut flowers from campus lawns or arty incense holders or other objects that men never put on their shopping lists. Wait is aid. I turned around to do a quick scan. No there was no underwear or smelly socks or porn magazines or old razor blades in sight. I held the door open. Mugging away she asked as she sat on the bed. No choice. I pulled back my study chair. DX www.desibbrg.com Your grades will improve as you dont study with me anymore. Its nothing like that I said. Then what is the matter What is this childish behavior Like you dont even acknowledge me in class. I looked away from her. Eye contact please. I looked at her. I had missed her so much I wanted to lock my room and never let her go. I cant I said. Cant what I cant be just friends. Im sure some guys can be friends with girls. I cant. Not with you. What She sat up straight. I know you are out of my league and I dont deserve you and whatever so spare me all that and. What are you talking about she sounded confused. Forget it. Thanks for the Frooti I said. I took a long gurgling sip to finish the drink. I slammed the tetrapack on the table like a retro Hindi film hero who takes the last sip of his VAT. Yes leave me alone as I drown my suffering in mango juice I thought. Hey. She touched my shoulder. Dont put your hand on my shoulder I said as her touch sent tingles down the back of my neck. OK peace. She moved her hand away. But this is sort of not fair. We had a deal. Screw the deal I said as I crumpled the Frooti carton and threw it in my dustbin. We exchanged glances silent for a minute. What do you want she asked. DX www.desibbrg.com I want us to be a couple I said. And this is not a proposal. I am not Mr. Fourteen. She stared at me. I stared back to show I was unfazed. If this isnt a proposal what is it You have come to my room. You asked me what I want. Its different. But you want us to be a couple. Her voice was still defiant. I nodded. We used to practically be a couple studying together going to the STD booth together having meals in the mess together. All that stuff you can do with anyone I said. You arent making any sense she said. OK I will explain it I said and stood up. I will explain it so it makes sense. To sit and study with you is an exercise in double selfcontrol. First I have to force myself to pay attention to these boring cases. Second I have to avoid looking at your face as much as possible because when I look at your face all I want to do is kiss you. But we have this stupid justfriends deal and you are all cool about it and so that leaves me whipping my mind to study nicotinefree cigarettes and not think about your lips and the little mole that is there below the lower one. You noticed that mole Its tiny. She touched it. It may be tiny but it at least has a fifty percent market share in terms of my mindspace. But hey I am just a friend. I dont get the mole. I only get the full stops. She laughed. I am not being funny. You girls dont know what it is like to be a guy. Those lips talk a lot. Yours I mean she said. I froze. Ms Swaminathan didnt as she came close to me. In a second her Frootilaced lips were on mine. We kissed for three seconds. And now before I realize the stupidity of what I have done I am out of here she said and opened the door. I was too dumbstruck to move. DX www.desibbrg.com Four boys from my dorm removed their ears from the door as Ananya pushed the door open. We were just locating our Frisbee one of the four boys said. It wont be in this room. This boy only likes to study she said and walked out of my dorm. I didnt move an inch for five minutes. The remaining three minutes were spent realizing that the hottest girl in the campus had kissed me. I didnt know what Id done right. But I didnt care. Maybe she had missed me too. Maybe it wasnt such a big deal for her. Maybe I was just imagining this and this hadnt really happened. Maybe I should stop dreaming like an idiot and run to her room. Maybe I shouldnt as I had no idea what to do when I meet her. Maybe I should let a night pass and talk to her in class tomorrow. Dont keep mentioning it she said as the same lips that were on mine thirteen hours and twentytwo minutes ago sipped tea during class break. Yes sure OK. I had already thanked her seven times. I changed the topic. The normal distribution is totally overrated I said referring to the statistics class we had attended. And dont expect more Ananya said. More what I said. She had brought the topic back now. More meaning not anymore. Now just back to what you said about the normal curve she said. Sorry only one clarification. By more you mean no more kisses or no more than kissing Can you stop it We are in the middle of a class. But I am in the middle of a life crisis. Please tell me. DX www.desibbrg.com Is that all you guys think about We have to study all these normal curve problems tonight. I looked at her and smiled. Any jokes about curves and I will kill you she promised as the bell rang for class. DX www.desibbrg.com Needless to say one thing led to another and within two weeks we had sex. You put a boy and girl in a room for a week and lots of boring books and sparks are sure to fly. This is my first time she said after we did it and pointed to her mothers picture on the wall. And if she finds out she will flip. We should cover these pictures when we do it. They freak me out I said scanning her family members. She laughed. Was this your first time Id rather not talk about it I said. Did you have a girlfriend in IIT She sat up to wear her top. I kept quiet. Did you have sex with a guy Ananya asked eyebrows up. No I screamed and sat up. Are you stupid You of all people are asking me if I am gay. I heard they make you do all sorts of stuff in ragging. No it wasnt that bad. I had a girlfriend. Really She blinked. How come you never told me I dont want to talk about it. Its over. It ended when I left college two years ago. Why Who was she A student Profs daughter. My my my We have a stud here. Then Pretty Prettier than me I looked at Ananya. Why do women size each other up in looks so much Similar though you are much smarter I said. Similar DX www.desibbrg.com OK you are better looking I said. The girl who asks the question is the better looking one always. Thank you she said as she stepped off the bed to wear her track pants. Why did it end I sort of had a deal with her father. Father What he bought you out Gave you a blank cheque like in films she laughed. No he let me have my degree on time. Because of which I am here. But the implicit deal was dont push it. Dont dream of being family. There was no future so it died. My throat closed up as I thought about my previous girlfriend. Somehow it never really gets over with an ex. You merely learn to push their thoughts aside. Unless someone prods your brain again to think of them. Can we leave it now Where is she now Campus No father went to the US to a senior faculty post in MIT. She found a geeky guy of the same community. Engaged in six months married in a year. Rest I dont know. Now even though we were naked a few moments ago I do think I can make a case for invasion of privacy. Well it affects me. In case you are still involved with her. Im not. It took me a long time to get over her but I am not involved anymore. Did you love her Yes. And I feel sick I didnt have the courage to fight her father. And no more talk about her please I said. My exgirlfriend and my father were offlimit topics. One last question. Is she South Indian How do you know You mentioned IIT MIT geeky software programmer it wasnt that hard. I laughed. My parents are pretty conservative too she said switching on her electric kettle. We havent planned to get married yet. DX www.desibbrg.com She stared at me. I wondered if I had said the wrong thing. I was being factual. You are right. We are just friends with benefits right Or what is it Fuck buddies She looked upset. It is amazing how the vulnerability in a relationship shifts from the guy to the girl after youve had sex. Hey we.. But she interrupted me. Sorry I am freaking out. Have tea. She passed me a cup. I twiddled with the handle for two minutes. Despite the sexual possibilities we still had to study. Should we open the HR case It is about a strike in a hotel I said as I opened my folder. She nodded without eye contact. I racked my brain hard on what I could say that could make her feel better. I love you I said. She carefully closed her case materials and looked up at me. Mean it She said her eyes wet. Yes I said. You are not just saying it so you can have sex with me again No. but are you saying that. I am not saying anything. Is that all you think about We study together eat together go out together sit in class looking at each other all day the only time we are apart is when I have to go to sleep or when I have to use the toilet. So I paused. So what I love you damn it Dont you get it I yelled. Thats better. Now you sound convincing. She smiled. And you I asked. Im going to think about it. Excuse me DX www.desibbrg.com Well I could be only using you for sex she said. Excuse me I said this time louder. She laughed. I threw a pillow at her. I told you. I have to think about it. Even though she never said I love you Ms Swaminathan moved in with me. I had freaked out about the idea when she arrived at my room one day with a backpack for overnight clothes. Id have much preferred her place as I didnt want her to be the only woman in the dorm with twenty testosteronecharged men. Still it was kind of nice. She brought her electric kettle sweet smile and magimaking abilities with her. While we used to study together earlier now there was even more discipline. When a woman comes into your life things organize themselves. We woke up in the morning she half an hour earlier than me. She would rush to her dorm a hundred metres away and bathe there. Id get ready and meet her at the mess for breakfast. This is your assignment and this is my quant worksheet. Shed take out the stack of work from last night and divide it in the mess. Wed go to class together and if Kanyashree was in a good mood shed switch places with Ananya for a day. Otherwise wed take our original seats and stare at each other through class. The five Mohits were quite amused at first but later adjusted quite well and turned to check us out only when the lecture got boring. In fact her moving in with me created a mini scandal. Like it always happens I earned the tag of a stud. And she earned tags ranging from stupidlyinlove to slut. But it didnt matter to her as maybe she was stupidly in love. Every day in class she would pass me a note. DX www.desibbrg.com I miss you. Cant wait to cuddle with you after class it said and it came to me via Ankur Bipin Bhupin ten other students and Kanyashree. We lived with each other yet she missed me in class from six rows away. Stop sending such notes in class. People will open them I warned. You are no fun she replied with several sad smiles. Bipin smiled as he passed the note. OK so someone had entertainment in class. You are a whisker away from being in the top ten. One more A in the statistics final exam and you are there she said one night three months after she had moved in with me. I cant believe Im studying so much. In IIT all wed do is chat all night. I switched off the lights. We could chat all night she said as we tucked under the quilt together. About what And why We are with each other all the time. Why sacrifice sleep Still we could talk. Future plans and stuff. The word future and females is a dangerous combination. Still in business school future could merely mean placement. Weve good grades. Youll easily get HLL. It is the best marketing job right And Ill go for WPM. WPM Whoever pays more so I can save as much money as fast as possible I grinned. You still serious about becoming a writer right She ran her fingers through my hair. Yes but Im still wondering what Id write about I yawned. DX www.desibbrg.com About anything. Like that girlfriend of yours. Ananya we had a pact. We will not talk about my exgirlfriend again. Sorry sorry. You said you had a deal with the Prof for grades so I thought maybe it will make an interesting story. Good night my strategist. I kissed her and lay down. I love you she said. Mean it Yes. How come you said it now I think about it a lot. I only articulated it now. Good night she said. Oneand ahalf years later Tell me your thoughts. Dont you like to talk after making love Actually I prefer to look at the fan above. Or drift into a nap. Why do women want to talk all the time We were in my room. We were snugly wrapped up on a cloudy winder afternoon. I love to talk I said carefully. Do you have something in mind Its one week to placement and Im nervous she said. Dont worry every company has shortlisted you. You will hit t he jackpot. Im not nervous about receiving a job offer. What after that After that Finally we will have money in the bank. No more scrimping while ordering in restaurants no more front row seats in theatres no more secondclass train travel. College is fun but sorry Ive had my share of slumming it. Imagine you can shop every month DX www.desibbrg.com I dont like shopping. Fine you can save the money. Or travel to exotic places. Her face turned more thoughtful. You OK I asked. Do you realize we leave campus in four weeks Good riddance. No more mugging and grades hopefully for life I said. Her voice dropped an octave. What about us About us what I asked with an idiotic confused expression exclusive to men when they have to get all meaningful with women. She sat up and wore her top. She stepped off the bed to wear the rest of her clothes. Despite the serious mood I couldnt help but notice how wonderful women looked when they change. Im going to my room. Enjoy your nap she said. Hey I extended my arm and stopped her. Whats up I am talking no But like a dork. We could be in different cities in four weeks. It will never be like this again. What do you mean never I said my mouth open. Wear your clothes first. I want to have a serious discussion. She kept quiet until I finished dressing. We sat across crosslegged on the bed. Here is the deal I said collecting my thoughts. You are the career focused one I am doing it for the money. So I will try to get a job in the same city as you. But the issue is we dont know which city you will be in. So how can I do anything about it now And what will you do next week We are all going to get placed around the same time. You cant wait for me to get a job. So let fate play out I said. And what about our future Or sorry I should ask is there a future I cant really talk about that now I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Oh really can you give me a time in the future when we can talk about the future I kept quiet. Forget it Im leaving she said and made for the door. I need time to think I said. Two years are not enough I kept quiet. You know it baffles me Ananya said how you men need so much time to think about commitment but how you need no time at all to decide when you have to sleep with the girl. Ananya I began only to hear the door slam shut. Youll be fine she told me for the fifth time. We took a fourkilometre walk outside campus to reach Navrangpura. I wanted to be as far from the madness as possible. Day Zero or the first day of placement had ended and I hadnt got a job. I thought with my grades I will crack Day Zero I said. Who cares Therere six more days left for placements she said. We stopped at a roadside vendor for paobhaji. She ordered two plates with less butter. You will be fine. See marketing companies dont even start until tomorrow. I have my big HLL interview. Im not stressed. Youll get in. I cant think of a single company who can say no to you I said. She looked at me and smiled. You do realize that not everyone is in love with me. DX www.desibbrg.com You have good grades and a passion for marketing. You are so HLL I can see it on your face. You have two more banks tomorrow. I want Citibank I said. I should have better answers than I like the money. I need to lie better in interviews. The waiter served us. She broke a piece of the pao and fed me. But thats the only reason why anyone would work in a bank right Yes but the interviewers like to believe they are doing something meaningful. Like they work for the Mother Teresa Foundation or something. Well you should say this I want Citibank as I want Indians to have access to worldclass financial services. And use words like enormous growths and strategic potential she said. I have to say all that without throwing up And remember the Citi never sleeps. So say you will work hard she said. I cant lie that much I said. She laughed as she wiped a bit of bhaji off the corner of my mouth. I thought how lucky I was to have her. She could be running HLL in a few years but today her priority was to wipe bhaji off my stupid face. Guilt knotted within me. She deserved an answer about the future. Do it loser I told myself. Do it now. Even if it is a makeshift pao bhaji stall in Navrangpura. I gathered the courage to sopeak. What You want to say something Do you want more pao I said. You are third a firstyear student volunteer who assisted in placements told me. I sat on a stool with seven other candidates outside the interview room. We resembled patients at a dentists clinic only more stressed. DX www.desibbrg.com The HLL interviews were on in the room across me. Ananya had moved up all the rounds and now waited to be called one last time. I reflected on what had gone wrong on Day Zero. OK I only wanted a job for the money but I had hidden that when they spoke to me. Then why did I screw up with five banks yesterday What if Citi also screws me I thought. Sweat beads popped on my forehead. Was it destiny leading me to doom after all these degrees and grades Is God not on my side I wondered if I had given any reason to God not to be on my side. I saw the HLL room from a distance. Ananya stood outside looking beautiful in a peacock blue sari. Maybe God will not let me decide my future unless I give her clarity on her future. Krish Malhotra the student volunteer called my name. I offered mental prayers and stood up. I checked my tie knot and shirt collars. Remember you need this job I told myself. Banks pay double I could quit a corporate career twice as fast to do whatever I wanted to. I breathed in deeply and exhaled. Welcome take you seat a man in an impeccable black suit spoke from his chair. He was rich enough to wear a Rolex watch and obnoxious enough not to look at me while he addressed me. He rifled through a pile of resumes to find mine. Good afternoon. I extended my hand. I flexed my forearm muscles as people say a tight handshake is a sign of confidence and world domination. Rahul Ahuja managing director corporate finance he said and shook hands with me. He pointed to his colleague on the right. And this is Devesh Sharma vicepresident in HR. I looked at Devesh a thirtyyearold executive with the timidity of a threeyearold. He came across as someone who could be kicked around despite being called vicepresident. Anyway Id heard Citibank had four hundred vicepresidents to accommodate careers and egos of hundreds of new MBAs that joined every year. Of course it took away the relevance of the title but at least it gave you a good introduction. Rahul signaled Devesh to start. So Krish I notice you have poor grades in your undergrad Devesh spoke in a voice so effeminate hed be the obvious choice for female leads in college plays. You are pretty observant I said. Excuse me Devesh said surprised. Cut the wisecracks I told myself. Nothing I cleared my throat. DX www.desibbrg.com So what happened A girlfriend funloving friends alcohol grass and crap profs happened I wanted to say. But Ananya had told me the right answer. Actually Mr. Sharma I said emphasizing his name so he felt good when I entered IIT I didnt realize the rigours demanded by the system. And once you have a bad start due to relative grading it is quite hard to come back. I did get good grades in the last semester and my IIMA grades are good. So as you can see Ive made up. There were twenty minutes of stupid questions like will credit cards grow in India or can India improve its banking services where you easily answer what they want to hear yes they will grow and yes India can improve heaps. Finally they asked the big question Why Citibank I want Citibank because none of the other five banks worked out. I sucked in my breath along with my stupid thoughts. BS time buddy I thought the ten seconds that will determine your career start now. Mr Ahuja the question is not why Citi. The real question is why would any ambitious young person want to go anywhere else It is the biggest private bank in the world it has a great reputation it is committed to India and there are opportunities in almost every area of the bank. It is not a bank it is a growth machine. I paused to see if I had gone over the top. But Rahul listened with rapt attention and Devesh nodded. Yes they were falling for it. And ultimately the biggest reason is Rahul I said switching to the first name to show my closeness to him I really want to work with people I look up to. When I see you I want to be you. And Citi gives me a shot at it. Rahul flushed with pride. HowI mean how do you know you want to be me No matter how accomplished people get they dont stop fishing for compliments. I saw you at the preplacement talk. Ive attended dozens of talks but the way you presented showed more thought clarity than anyone else. I think it is a Citibank thing. You people have a different confidence. Right Devesh Devesh looked at me perplexed. Actually we at human resources pick the best talent he parroted probably from a manual. HR does nothing. I personally pick everyone for the job Rahul said as the two jostled for my attention. DX www.desibbrg.com It shows I said. Rahul pushed back his chair and stood up. Listen Krish I like you. So between us let me be honest. We are mostly done with the recruitment and have only one place left. But we have internal criteria we need sevenpoint grade in undergrad to take new recruits. Fuck. My past sins would not let go of me. Maybe that is why the five banks had rejected me. and this missed semester. He tapped my undergrad grade sheete. Research semester sir I corrected. I dont know about that. Devesh Devesh like anyone who works in HR had never taken a real decision in his life. Its a business call sir he said. I head my business Rahul said. Yes but you may want to talk to the country manager Devesh said scared to make a suggestion. Im senior to him. I came from New York. Hes just connected so he became country manager. You know that right Sir but gradewise. Devesh paused and both of them looked at me. Can you give us five minutes Rahul asked. Sure Ill wait outside I obliged with an ingratiating grin. Thanks well call you in again. So dont send the next candidate. DX www.desibbrg.com I stepped out of the Citi interview room. I scanned the list of remaining companies on the notice board. Everyone else paid half of Citibank. I found an empty stool to sit on and closed my eyes to pray. God appeared in front of me. Hello God I said Ive not said one true thing in that interview today. But I want the job please. They dont want to hear the truth. So thats OK God said. But thats not what you should be worried about. Then what You have lived with a girl for two years. I love her God I said. Love is not enough. You know what you have to do. I will I just need time. You are well past your time. In four minutes I could let your last bank job slip away God said. No God I want Citibank. I want you to do the right thing first. How I opened my eyes. I looked at the HLL room. Ananya had gone inside the room. I closed my eyes again. How I repeated. She is in an interview. I promise to do it after I get my Citibank job. I dont trust you. Anyway upto you. You dont listen to me I dont listen to you God said. I opened my eyes. I had three minutes. Ananya would kill me if I went inside the room. But a voice inside told me that if I didnt go to her the Citi country manager or Rahul or Devesh could decide against me. Of course my rational mind knew I was being completely moronic. Both the events were not connected. But there is only so much our rational mind knows. Maybe events and karma are connected. I ran to the HLL room. Excuse me the volunteer on the door said blocking me. DX www.desibbrg.com I need to go inside I said urgent. Theres an inter. I forced my way inside. HLL was conducting its final interviews in one of the classrooms. The company staff sat in the front row of the class while the candidate sat in the profs chair. Ananya faced a panel of five elderly people in the room. She was moving her hands in an animated manner as she spoke. The rural market doesnt need different products. They need affordability. She stopped midsentence upon noticing me. Her eyebrows elevated in shock and stayed there. Yes a sixtyishyearold gentleman turned to me. Ananyas face turned pink then red. The colour coordination came from embarrassment and anger respectively. I need to talk to her I said slowly scanning everyone in the room. Cant it wait the old gentleman asked. She is having her final interview. All our senior management is here. Actually it cant I said. Everything OK another panelist said. Yes I only need a minute I said and signalled to Ananya to come out. What Just tell me here she said throwing me a dirty look. I saw the panels confused expression. I went up to Ananya. What she whispered Are you mad I knelt down next to her my mouth close to her ear. Sorry how is it going I whispered. Krish Malhotra this better be important. Whats up she whispered loud enough for the panel to hear. Ananya Swaminathan I Krish Malhotra am deeply in love with you and want to be with you always. Apart from where we go to office of course. Will you marry me DX www.desibbrg.com Ananyas mouth fell open. She alternated her glance between the panel and me. Krish she said. She tried hard but a tear slipped out of her carefully eyelined eyes. Everything OK one panel member asked as he noticed Ananyas restlessness. Its not bad news I hope. Ananya shook her head as she took a sip from the glass of water in front of her. No its not bad news at all. Its good. Ananya I whispered again. My knees hurt as they rubbed against the rough classroom floor. What now Is that a yes Will you be with me always I asked. She tightened her lips to hide a laugh. Yes you idiot. I will be with you. Just not right now. So go DX www.desibbrg.com Wow this feels special Ananya said. She opened her HLL offer letter for the third time at Rambhais. I had collected mine from Citibank the day before and after confirming the salary had dumped it in my cupboard. Its an invitation to be a slave dont get so excited I said as I ordered a samosa sandwich. Aw dont be morbid. They are thrilled about hiring me. HLL has a serious South India strategy. Rambhais minions served us tea. During placement time tips peaked for them. Do you go to school Ananya asked the thirteenyearold boy who served us. Yes Rambhai sends me the boy said. Good because if he doesnt report him to the police Ananya said and gave the boy a fifty rupee note. They will post you in South India is aid in one of those unpronounceable places without an STD code. No they wont. And if they do my husband will come and rescue me. She winked. Ananya you dont get it. We have decided to get married. Our parents havent approved yet I reminded her. Cmon mine are a bit conservative. But we are their overachieving children the ultimate middleclass fantasy kids. Why would they have an issue Because they are parents. From biscuits to brides if there is anything their children really want parents have a problem I said. Your parents will have a problem with me Ananya pulled her hair back to tie it in a loose bun. She clenched a pin in the middle of her teeth. DX www.desibbrg.com Theyd have a problem with anyone I choose. And you are South Indian which doesnt help at all. OK its not as bad as marrying someone from another religion. But pretty close. But I also aced my college. I have an MBA from IIMA and work for HLL. And sorry to brag but I am kind of pretty. Irrelevant. You are Tamilian. I am Punjabi. Ananya folded her offer letter and rearranged things in her bag. What Say something Cant be part of this backward conversation she said. Please discuss your woes with the Punjabi brethren. She stood up to leave. I tugged her down by her hand. Cmon Ananya arent your parents going to flip out when they find out you have a Punjabi boyfriend No I dont think so. Have you told them No. Why Waiting for the appropriate time. The convocation is in two weeks. Theyll be here I will introduce you. Tell them what you have done in life not where your ancestors were born. They can meet your parents. They are coming right My mother yes. Father I dont know. Whats the deal Lets not talk about it. You wont tell your future wife Have you invited him No. She stood up I followed suit. Lets go to the STD booth she said. Now This strong and silent warfare between you and your dad is becoming too much. DX www.desibbrg.com Its peak hour rates. I dont care. We walked to the STD booth near Vijay Char Rasta. I called home. Hi mom it is me. Krish we should book tickets. I am coming Shipra masi wants to come Rajji mama and Kamla aunty too. Mom is dad coming No she said and fell silent. Its my convocation I said. He said he has work. Hes retired. What work the meter rode up twenty rupees. You talk to him he expects a personal invitation my mother said. I wont. Doesnt he want to come by himself No why dont you ask him to She prepared to put me on hold. Mom no. I dont want to call him if he doesnt want to come. Fine. Can masi and mama come Dont get any relatives I pleaded. Why They love you so much. They want to see you. I want you to meet someone mom. Who Youll find out I said. I came out of the booth. Ananya and I walked back. Which father needs an invitation from his son to attend his convocation Screw him I said to myself. You invited him Ananya asked. Dads not coming I said. Why DX www.desibbrg.com We have no relationship Ananya. Dont try to fix it ever. OK What happened though I dont want to talk about it. Standard answer. Yours was a standard question. You do care for him. You are upset. Im upset about paying peak hour rates. Now listen Ive fended off my aunts with great difficulty. Its only my mom. You have a plan right She skipped ahead of me. Lets make it a great first meeting of the families. We should do something fun together. Like shoot each other Shut up. Itll be fine. Theyd love it that my boyfriend is from IIT. They wont ask my grades right They might. But who cares you will be in Citibank. Listen we organize an outing for them I am not so sure if our families would like to spend so much time together. Of course they would. You leave it to me. Your mom will love me more than you after this she said as we reached the campus gates. I received my mother at the Ahmedabad railway station a day before the convocation. Ananyas parents flew down her father using his LTC that allowed him to fly once every four years. My mother arrived with two suitcases. One had her clothes and the other contained mithai boxes sourced from various shops in Delhi. DX www.desibbrg.com Im in college for five more days. Why so many sweets I asked in the auto back to campus. We will eat them no And we might meet people. They will say her son is graduating and she has nothing to offer us. I almost brought packed meals. I dont want to eat the Gujarati daal with sugar. Is it really sweet Its not that sweet. Anyway I want you to meet someone mom I said as the auto struggled to penetrate the narrow lanes near the railway station. Who Theres this girl I said. You have a Girlfriend Girlfriend she asked as if I had contacted AIDS. A good friend I said to calm her down. Good friend What you have bad friends also No mom. We used to study together. We did a lot of projects together. OK. Did she get a job Yes in HLL. Its a good job. HLL The company that makes Surf. And Rin and Lifebuoy and Kissan Sauce. I named products hoping that one of them would impress her. Kissan Jams also she asked after thinking for thirty seconds. Yes. She is in marketing. Its the most prestigious marketing job. She will get free jams then I guess I said wondering how to bring the conversation back on track. But thats not the point. Yes its not. So should we stop for lunch before we go to your college or do we eat in college Bhaiya any good restaurants here she addressed the auto driver. Mom stop. I am talking about something important. But my mother said These auto drivers always know good places. DX www.desibbrg.com Stopping is extra madam the auto driver said ignoring me along with every speedbreaker on the road. What my mother said as I continued to stare at her to get her attention. Her name is Ananya. Her parents are also here. I want you to meet them and be nice to them. I will meet whoever you want me to meet. And when am I not nice We are nice people only. Mom.. I said before she interrupted me. Lets take some Nice biscuits on the way. They are good with tea. Mom I screamed. This is what I dont want. I want you to meet them properly and not obsess about meals or snacks or tea or whatever. They should have a good impression. My mother gave me a dirty look. I didnt respond. Bhaiya turn the auto. I am going back my mother said. One I come all the way from Delhi to attend your convocation get mithai from four different shops and now I cant make a good impression. Its OK if we cant make a good impression then we wont come. My mother kept mumbling to herself. She had officially entered her drama mode. The driver stopped the auto. What Why have you stopped I asked exasperated. Madam is telling me to turn back. Mom I said as she continued to sulk. So you remember I am your mother I thought you only cared about your friends parents Anger filled my mothers voice. I had to take emergency measures. There is an excellent paobhaji place round the corner. Bhaiya just take us to Law Garden. Im not hungry my mother said. Only for tasting I said. I tapped the auto driver on his shoulder. The driver turned towards Law Garden. DX www.desibbrg.com I ordered paneer paobhaji with extra butter and lassi on the side. Nothing soothes an upset Punjabi like dairy products. Who is this girl she asked after finishing the lassi. Nobody important. She wanted to meet you after I told her how much trouble you took to bring me up because of dad I lied. Maybe it was the extra butter or my words. My mother calmed down. You told her everything she asked. No only a little. Also her parents may be a bit formal. Thats why I spoke about making a good impression. Otherwise who wouldnt love to meet you What do Gujaratis eat for dessert Or do they put all the sugar in their food My mother picked up the menu again. DX www.desibbrg.com The next morning two hundred fresh MBA graduates and their insanely proud parents sat in the Louis Kahn Plaza lawns for the convocation. The cief guest a third generation silverspoonatbirth industrialist told students to work hard and come to the top. He also had the tough job of handling out degrees and posing for pictures with two hundred students. Today we had to collect our postgraduate diploma in management a ticket to a lifetime of overpaid jobs. Ananya wanted everything to be perfect. She had reached the venue half an hour earlier to secure six seats for her family and mine. My mother wore her best sari. I wore graduation robes rented for thirty bucks. Mom this is Ananya. Ananya my mother I said when we reached the premises. Ananya extended her arm to shake my mothers hand. My mother looked shocked. While Ananya touching her feet would be too much I felt Ananya should have stuck to a Namaste. Anything modern doesnt go down well with parents. Hello aunty. I have heard so much about you Ananya said. Actually since I have arrived I am only hearing about you. My mother smiled making it difficult to spot the sarcasm. Lets sit down. Ananya where is your family I asked as we sat down. My mother takes forever to put on her sari. I came first to get good seats. Ananya wore the same peacock blue sari that she wore to her HLL interview. She caught me staring and blew a kiss. Fortunately my mother didnt notice. I shook my head beseeching Ananya to maintain decorum. Ananyas parents arrived ten minutes later. Her father wore a crisp white shirt like the one in detergent ads. Ananyas mother walked behind in a glittery haze. Her magenta and gold Kanjeevaram sari could be noticed from any corner of the lawn. She looked as if she had fallen into a drum of golden paint. Behind her walked a fourteenyearold boy with spectacles a miniature version of MBA men who would get a degree this evening. Hello mom Ananya said and stood up her voice her cheerful best. DX www.desibbrg.com Safety pin illa something something her mother replied. Mother and daughter lapsed into Tamil. Ananyas father took out his camera and started taking random pictures of everything around us the lawns the stage the chairs the mikes. Little brother didnt have much to do but looked uncomfortable in his new buttondown collar shirt. My mother heard them talk and her mouth fell open. I whispered Get up. Let us introduce ourselves. They are Madrasi my mother asked shocked. Shsh Tamilian I said. Tamilian my mother echoed even as Ananya continued the introductions. Mom this is Krish and this is Krishs mother. Hello Ananyas mother said looking just as stunned as my mother. Isnt this cool Our families meeting for the first time Ananya cooed even as everyone ignored her. Krishs father has not come Ananyas father asked. He is not well my mother said her voice buttersoft. He is a heart patient. Advised not to travel. My mother faked it so well even I felt like sympathizing with her. Ananyas parents gave understanding nods. They whispered to each other in Tamil as they took their places. I better go Im one of the first ones. Ananya giggled and ran up to join the line of students. I sat sandwiched between my mother on one side and Ananyas mother on the other. You want to sit next to Ananyas mother I asked my mother. Why Who are these people she frowned. Dont panic mom. I said it because I have to join that line soon. Then go. I have come to see you not sit next to Madrasis. Now let me watch she said. DX www.desibbrg.com The chief guest started the diploma distribution. The audience broke into continuous applause for the initial students. Then they got tired and went back to fanning themselves with the convocation brochures. Get to know them. Well probably go for lunch together I said. You go for lunch with them. I can eat alone my mother said. Mom. I said as the announcer read out Ananyas name. Ananya walked on the stage probably the only student whose picture was worth taking. I stood up and applauded. My mother gave me a dirty look. Sit. Even her parents are not standing. Maybe they dont love her like I do I wanted to say but didnt. I sat down. Ananyas parents clapped gently craning their necs to get a better view. Ananyas mother looked at me with suspicion. I realized that I hadnt yet spoken to her. Start a conversation you idiot I thought. Your daughter is such a star. You must be so proud I said. We are used to it. She always did well in school Ananyas mother replied. I tried her father. How long are you here for uncle Uncle looked up and down at me as if I had questioned him about his secret personal fantasies. We leave day after. Why he said. Some whys have no answer apart from the fact that I was trying to make small talk. Nothing Ananya and I were wondering if you wanted to see the city. We can share a car I said. Ananyas mother sat between us and listened to every word. She spoke to her husband in Tamil. Something something Gandhi Ashram something recommend something. Gandhi Ashram is nice. My mother also wants to see it. I said. What my mother said from her seat. Dont you have to go on stage Krish Your turn is coming. DX www.desibbrg.com Yes I said and stood up. Gandhi Ashram would be a good start for the families. He stood for peace and national integration maybe that could inspire us all. Then go my mother said. Wait I said and bent to touch her feet. Thank god you remembered. I thought you were going to touch Ananyas mothers feet she said. My mother said it loud enough for Ananyas mother to hear. They exchanged cold glances that could be set to the backdrop of AK bullets being fired. Surely it would take a Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi to make them get along. Mom control I whispered to her as I turned to leave. I am under control. These South Indians dont know how to control their daughters. From Hema Malini to Sridevi all of them trying to catch Punjabi men. My mother had spoken so loud that the entire row heard her. For a few moments peoples attention shifted from the convocation ceremony to us. Ananyas mother elbowed her husband. They stood up pulled up Ananyas scrawny brother between them and found some empty seats five rows away. Mom what are you doing I struggled to balance the graduation cap on my head. Kanyashree Banerjee the announcer said over the mike and I realised I was horribly late. I had missed my last convocation as I had overslept. I didnt want to miss it this time. What have I said Its a fact my mom said talking to me but addressing everyone who had tuned into our conversation that beat the boring degree distribution hollow any day. Krish. I heard my name and ran up. The five Mohits were waiting near the stage. I smiled at them as I climbed the steps to the stage. The chief guest gave me my diploma. My mother was standing and clapping. I love you she screamed. I smiled back at her. For the last ten years my father had told her that her son would get nowhere in life. I held up my diploma high and looked up to thank God. DX www.desibbrg.com Move the next student has to come the announcer said as I emotionally thanked the chief guest again and again. As I walked down the steps I saw Ananyas parents. They had not applauded or even reacted to my being on the stage. I came back towards my seat. Ananya stood at our rows entrance looking lost. I stayed back to get some pictures with friends. Where are my parents Five rows behind I said. Why What happened Nothing. They wanted a better view I said. Ive booked the car. We are all going afterwards right Go to your parents Ananya I said firmly as I saw my mother staring at me. DX www.desibbrg.com Weve already paid for the taxi I said. So you can pretend to get along. See it as a budget exercise. My mother and I walked towards the taxi stand outside campus. She had no inclination to see where MR Gandhi lived. The Sabarmati Ashram on the outskirts of the city was a key tourist attraction. Ananya had got lunch packed in little packets from Topaz. According to her it would be a Kodak moment to picnic somewhere by the Sabarmati river. Of course she had no idea about her missed Kodak moment when my mother had made insightful comments about certain South Indian actresses. We had booked a Qualis I told the driver who stood next to an Indica. Ananya and her family were already at the taxi stand. Her mother looked like she had just finished a grumble session maybe her natural expression. The Qualis is on election duty. We only have this. The driver crushed tobacco in his palm. How can we all fit in I wondered. We take double the passengers squeeze in the driver said. Lets take an auto I said. Im not taking an auto my mother said as she slid into the backseat. You can sit in front and make madam sit in your lap the driver pointed Ananya to me. Ananyas mother gave the driver a glare strong enough to silence him for the rest of the day. Mom can you take an auto Ananya requested her mother. Why we have also paid for this she said. Something something illa illa Seri seri Amma Ananya said. We finally arrived at an arrangement. Ananyas dad sat in front with Ananya in his lap. Ananyas mother sat behind with her son in her lap. My mother had DX www.desibbrg.com already taken a window seat behind the driver. I squished myself between the two ladies in the middle. The Sabarmati Ashram is eight kilometers away from campus. The twentyminute drive felt like an hour due to the silence. Ananya tried to make conversation with her parents. They pretended not to hear her as they kept their heads out of the windows. My mother took out a packet of Nice biscuits and started eating them without offering them to anyone. She took one biscuit and put it in my mouth to assert maternal rights on me. Of course I couldnt refuse. Why is everyone so silent Ananya said to me as we went to the ticket counter at the ashram. My mother made a silly comment at the convocation I said hoping Ananya wont seek details. What did she say Ananya asked as she fished for the required amount of money for six tickets. Its not important. But your parents left after that. What exactly did she say Ananya persisted. Nothing something about South Indian women being loose or something. No big deal. What Ananya looked at me shocked. I didnt say it. She did. Silly comment ignore it. I dont know what to say Ananya said. Nothing. Lets get everyone talking again I said as we walked to the main entrance. We came inside the ashram. Gandhi lived here from to . The famous Salt March started form this ashram. Ananya appointed a guide for no other DX www.desibbrg.com reason than to keep everyone walking together. We passed the exhibits various pictures paintings letters and articles of Gandhi. And when Mr. Gandhi left in for the Dandi March he vowed never to return to the ashram until India won its independence the guide said in a practiced voice. And he didnt after that day. Did he come back after India became free Ananyas mother wanted to know. Alas the guide sighed he couldnt. He was shot dead within six months of independence. My mother not to be left behind in asking of questions turned to the guide. Why is it called Dandi March Because he carried a stick The guide laughed. Like all his mannerisms his laugh was dramatic too. How little we know about the greatest man in India. No madam Dandi is the name of a place five hundred kilometers away from here. The guide took us to an exhibit of the map and pointed to the coastal town. Ananyas mother turned to her father and spoke in Tamil. Something something illa knowledge Punjabi people something. Seri seri Ananyas father said in a cursory manner engrossed in the map. Ananyas mother continued. Intellectually culturally zero. Something something crass uneducated something. I dont know if Ananyas mother realised her use of the few English words or maybe she planted them intentionally. She had made her comeback. My mother heard her and looked at me. The guide looked worried as his tip was in danger. So you see Gandhiji strongly believed that all Indians are one. Anyway let us now see Gandhijis personal belongings. This way please. The guide said breaking the Antarctic glances between the two mothers. We sat down for lunch under a tree in the ashram complex looking like we were on death row. Everyone ate in silence as Ananya dropped the news. We like each other. Everyone looked at each other in confusion. Most people did not like each other in this group. Krish and I we like each other Ananya smiled. I told you. I smelled something fishy My mother tore her chapatti. DX www.desibbrg.com Theres nothing fishy. Theres nothing to be worried about. We just wanted to share our happiness. We are just two people in love Ananya said as her mother interrupted her. Shut up Ananya Ananyas mother glared at her. I wondered if she would slap her. And I wondered if Ananya would offer her second cheek considering we were in Gandhis ashram. This is what I meant when I said about South Indian girls. There are so many cases in Delhi only my mother said itching to slam Ananyas mom again. Mom chill I said. What have I said Did I say anything my mother asked. Get up Ananyas mother said to her husband. Like a TV responding to a remote he stood. Ananyas brother followed. We will take an auto back Ananyas mother said. Ananya sat under the tree perplexed. Now you will stay with them Ananyas mother asked. Mom please Ananya sounded close to tears. Ananyas mother tugged at Ananya and pulled her away. The guide noticed them leave and looked puzzled. I paid him off and came back to my mother. She finished the last few spoons of Topazs paneer tikka masala under the tree. They are gone I said. Good. Therell be more space in the car she said. DX www.desibbrg.com ACT Delhi DX www.desibbrg.com What are you reading with such concentration my mother asked as she chopped bhindi on the dining table. Its the Citibank new employee form. I have to fill fifty pages. They want to know everything like where was your mother born. On the way from Lahore to Delhi. Your grandmother delivered me in a makeshift tent near Punjabi Bagh. Ill write Delhi I said. I had come home for the twomonth break before joining Citibank. Even in April Delhi temperature had already crossed forty degree centigrade. There wasnt much to do apart from calling Ananya once a day or waiting for her call. I sat with my mother as she prepared lunch. My father wasnt home nobody really sure or caring about where he was. Is this the form where you fill your location preference my mother asked. I looked at her hands a little more wrinkled then before I left to join college. She cut the top and tail of a bhindi and slit it in the middle. Yes I said. You chose Delhi right I kept quiet. What Yes I will I said. The phone rang. I rushed to pick it up. It was Sunday and cheaper STD rates meant Ananya would call at noon. Hi my honeybunch Ananya said. Obviously your mother is not around I said. I spoke in a low volume as my own mother kept her eyes on the bhindi but ears on me. Of course not. Shes gone to buy stuff for Varsha Porupu puja tomorrow. DX www.desibbrg.com Varsha what Varsha Porupu Tamil new year. Dont you guys know Uh yes of course Happy New Year I said. And have you sent in your Citibank form yet No have to fill a few final items I said. Youve given Chennai as your top location choice I will.wait. I picked up the phone and went as far from my mother as the curly landline wire allowed me. My mother expects me to put Delhi I whispered. And what do you want HLL has placed me in Chennai. I told you weeks ago. How are we going to make this work We will. But if I come to Chennai shell know it is for you. Fine then tell her that. How I dont know. They didnt give me a choice else I would have come to Delhi. I miss you sweets a lot. Please baby come soon. Im someone elses baby too quite literally. And she is watching me so I better hang up. Please say I love you. I do. No say it nicely. Ananya Just once. The three words together. I looked at my mother. She picked up the last bunch of bhindis and wiped them with a wet cloth. Her shiny knife symbolic of her current position in my love story gleamed in the afternoon light. Movies I love. You should see them too. DX www.desibbrg.com Aww thats not fair Ananya mockcried at the other end. Bye I said. OK love you. Bye she ended the call. I came back to the dining table. Out of guilt I picked up a few bhindis and started wiping them with a cloth. Madrasi girl Ananya I said. Stay away from her. They brainwash these people. Mom I like her. In fact I love her. See I told you. They trap you my mother declared. Nobody has trapped me mom I said as I thwacked a bhindi on the table. She is a nice girl. She is smart intelligent goodlooking. She has a good job. Why would she need to trap anyone They like North Indian men. Why Whats so special about North Indian men North Indians are fairer. The Tamilians have a complex. A complexion complex I chuckled. Yes huge my mother said. Mom she went to IIMA she is one of the smartest girls in India. What are you talking about And not that it matters but you have seen her. She is fairer than me. The fair ones are the most dangerous. Sridevi and Hema Malini. Mom stop comparing Ananya to Sridevi and Hema Malini I screamed and pushed the bhindi bowl on the table aside with my arm. The bowl pushed the knife which in turn rammed against my mothers fingers. She winced in pain as drops of blood flooded her right index fingers. Mom I am so sorry I said. I am so sorry. Its OK. Kill me. Kill me for this girl she wailed. DX www.desibbrg.com Mom I am not.. A drop of blood fell on my Citibank form. Now would be the time to betray your mother you idiot I thought. I am going to write Delhi I said. What Nothing. Where are the bandaids Dont worry I will cook the bhindi. Give me the masala. I bandaged my mother and had her recline on the sofa. I switched on the TV. I tried to find a channel with a soap opera that didnt show children disrespecting their parents. I filled each bhindi with masala over the next hour. Do you know how to switch on the gas she screamed form the living room as I hunted for matches in the kitchen. I do. Dont worry. I can show you Punjabi girls fair as milk she said her volume louder than the TV. I ignored her as I checked the cupboard for a vessel. Should we give a matrimonial ad Verma aunty downstairs gave it she got fifty responses even though her son is from donation college. You will get five hundred my mother said. Let it be mom I said. I ignited the stove and kept the pan over it. I poured cooking oil and opened the drawers to find cumin seeds. It was kept in the same place as when I left home for college over seven years ago. Actually I have a girl in mind. You have seen Pammi auntys daughter No. and I dont want to I said. Wait my mother said as a new wave of energy was unleashed within her. I heard her open the Godrej cupboard in her bedroom. She brought a wedding album to the kitchen. Lower the flame youll burn it. And why havent you switched on the exhaust she snatched the ladle from me and took control of the stove. She stirred the bhindi with vigour as she spoke again. Open this album. See the girl dancing in the baraat next to the horse. She is wearing a pink lehnga. Mom I protested. Listen to me also sometimes. Didnt I meet Jayalalithas family on your request DX www.desibbrg.com What Nothing see the picture. I opened the album. It was my second cousin Dinkis wedding to Deepu. The first five pages of the album were filled with face shots of the boy and girl in various kaleidoscopic combinations and enclosed by heartfilled frames. I flipped through the album and came to the pictures with the horse. I saw a girl in pink lehnga her face barely visible under a lot of hair. She was in the middle of a dance step with her hands held high and index fingers pointing up. Isnt she pretty My mother switched on the other gas stove and put a tawa on it to make rotis. She took out a rolling pin and dough. I cant make out I said. You should meet her. And here keep stirring the bhindi while I make the rotis She handed me the ladle. I dont want to meet anyone. Only once. Whats so special about her They have six petrol pumps. What Her father. He has six petrol pumps. And the best part is they have only two daughters. So each soninlaw will get three just imagine. What I said as I imagined myself sitting in a gas station. Yes they are very rich. Petrol pumps sell in cash. Lots of black money. And what does the girl do Is she educated She is doing something. These days you can do graduation by correspondence also. Oh so she is not even going to college College degrees you can get easily. They are quite rich. DX www.desibbrg.com Mom thats not the point. I cant believe you are going to marry me to a twelfth pass.oh forget it. Put this album away. And are the rotis done I am hungry. We can get an educated Punjabi girl. No I dont like any Punjabi girl. Your mother is a Punjabi my mother said in an upset tone. Thats not the point mom I said and opened the fridge to take out curd. I dont want any other girl. I have a girlfriend. Youll marry that Madrasi girl my mother asked seriously shocked for the first time since she found out about Ananya. I want to. In time of course. My mother slapped a roti on the tawa and then slapped her forehead. Lets eat I said ignoring her demonstrations of disappointment. We placed the food on the livingroom coffee table and sat down in front of the TV. The doorbell rang twice. Oh no its your father my mother said. Switch off the TV. Its OK I said. My mother gave me a stern glance. I reluctantly shut the television. My mother opened the door. My father came inside and looked at me. I turned away and came back to the table. Lunch my mother asked. My father did not answer. He came to the dining table and examined the food. You call this food he said. I glared at him. It took mom three hours to make it I said. My mother took out a plate for him. I dont want to eat this my father said. Why dont you say youve already eaten and come I butted in again. DX www.desibbrg.com My father stared at me and turned to my mother. This is the result of your upbringing. All the degrees can go to the dustbin. You only have this at the end. This and a job at Citibank that pays me three times at the start than what you ever earned in your life I wanted to say but didnt. I pulled the Citibank form close to me. My father went and touched the TV top. Its hot. Who watched TV I did. Any problem I said. I hope you leave home soon my father said. I hope you leave this world soon I responded mentally as I took my plate and left the room. I lay down in bed at night waiting to fall asleep. My mind oscillated between wonderful thoughts of Ananyas hair as they brushed against my face when we slept in campus and the argument with my father this afternoon. My mother came to my room and switched on the light. Ive fixed the meeting. Well go to Pammi auntys place day after tomorrow. Mom I dont.. Dont worry Ive told them we are coming for tea. Let me show you off a little. You wait and see they will ask me first. I am not interested I sat up on my bed. Come for the snacks. They are very rich. Even for ordinary guests they give dry fruits. Mom why should I come really Because it will make me happy. Is that reason enough she said and I noticed her wrinkled hand with the bandage. DX www.desibbrg.com OK I shrugged and slid back into bed. Now let me sleep. Excellent she said and switched off the lights as she left the room. I allowed my mind to be trapped again by thoughts of my South Indian girl. DX www.desibbrg.com Pammi aunty lived in Pitampura a hardcore Punjabi neighbourhood. Each lane in this area has more marble than the Taj Mahal. Every street smells of tomatoes cooking with paneer. We took an auto as my father never allowed us to take the car. My mother told the auto driver to stop a few houses away. We couldnt tell Pammi aunty we hadnt come by car. He had a meeting he dropped us outside and left my mother said as Pammi aunty came to greet us at the door. He should have come for a cold drink at least Pammi aunty said and escorted us in. Pammi auntys weight roughly matched the decade she lived in and that correlation had continued into the current nineties. Pammi aunty had been Ms Chandigarh thirtyseven years ago. A rich businessman snapped her soon after the title and gave her a life of extra luxury and extra calories. Now she weighed more than the three finalists put together. We walked to five steps to get to their living room. Pammi aunty had difficulty climbing them. My knees she mumbled as she took the last step. You are going for morning walk nowadays my mother asked. Where Kavitaji it is so hot. Plus I have satsang in the morning. Sit Pammi aunty said as she told her maid to get khus sharbat. We sank into a red velvet sofa with a twofeet deep sponge base. Actually even if you walk to satsang it can be good exercise my mother said. Six cars Kavitaji. Drivers sitting useless. How to walk Pammi aunty asked. She had demonstrated a fine Punjabi skill of showing off her wealth as part of an innocent conversation. My mother turned to me to repeat her comment. Six cars Krish you heard they have six cars. I didnt know how to respond. Maybe I was supposed to applaud. Which ones I said only because they kept staring at me. DX www.desibbrg.com I dont know. My husband knows. Just last week he bought a Honda. How much for my mother asked. It is almost courteous among Punjabis to encourage someone who is flaunting his wealth to brag some more. Seven lakh plus stereo changed for thirty thousand Pammi aunty said. Wow my mother said. He has also got a job with Citibank four lakh a year. To a nonPunjabi my mothers comment would be considered a nonsequitur. To a Punjabi it is perfect continuation. We are talking about lakh after all. Good. Your son has turned out bright she said. I guess to be rich is to be bright as she didnt ask for my IQ. Your blessings Pammiji my mother said. No no Pammi aunty said as she gloated over her possible role in my bagging the job. We had smiled at each other for another minute when Pammi aunty spoke again. Dry fruits No no Pammiji what formalities you are getting into my mother demurred. Rani get cashews and those Dubai dates Pammiji screamed. My mother gave a mini nod in appreciation of the international nuts. Wheres our Dolly my mother inquired claiming the heiress of three gas stations as hers without hesitation. Here only Dolly Pammi aunty screamed hard to reach the upper floors of the hydrocarbonfunded mansion. The servants were summoned to call Dolly downstairs. She takes forever to have a bath and get ready Pammi aunty said in mock anger as she took a fistful of cashews and forced them in my hands. Dont stop our daughter from looking beautiful Pammiji my mother said. Yes Dolly was already ours. Who knows ji about whose daughter she will become We only have two girls everything is theirs Pammi said and spread her arms to show everything. Yes the sofas hideous marble coffee tables curios fans air conditioners everything belonged to the daughters and their future husbands. I have to say for DX www.desibbrg.com a second the thought of owning half this house made me wonder if my mother was right. But the next second the thought of losing Ananya came to me. No I wouldnt give up Ananya for all the cashews and cash in the world. If only Pammi aunty allowed me to live in this house with Ananya. Dolly came scurrying down the steps with her perfume reaching us three seconds before her. Hello Auntiji Dolly said and went on to give my mother a tight hug. How beautiful our daughter has become my mother exclaimed. Dolly and I greeted each other with slight nods. She wore a winered slawar kameez with vertical gold stripes sunning down it. She was abnormally white and my mother was right she did remind me of milk. She sucked in her stomach a little though she wasnt fat. Her ample bosom matched Pammi auntys and it made me wonder how these women would even wean their children off without suffocating them. What are you doing these days Dolly my mother asked. BA pass aunty correspondence. You are also doing computer course tell that Pammi aunty said and turned to my mother Ill get more snacks Dolly tried to say something but was ignored as we had moved on to the interesting topic of food. No Pammiji. This is enough my mother said obviously daring her to serve us more. What are you saying You havent come at meal time so I just arranged dome heavy snacks. Raju get the snacks. And get both the red and green chutneys she shrieked to her servant. Raju and another servant brought in a gigantic tray with samosas jalebis chole bhature milk cake kachoris and of course the red and green chutneys. Twenty thousand calories were plonked on the table. You shouldnt have my mother said as she signalled the servant to pass the jalebis. Nothing ji just for tasting. You should have come for dinner. DX www.desibbrg.com I felt I would come across as a retard if I didnt talk to Dolly now. What computer course are you doing Microsoft Word Power Point Email I dont know just started. Looks quite hifi. Sure it does sound like a challenging programme I said and instantly felt guilty for my sarcasm. My friends are doing it so I joined. If it is too difficult Ill stop. You know all these things no Sort of I said. My mother and Pammi aunty had stopped talking the moment Dolly and I began a conversation. Dolly and I became quiet as we noticed them staring at us. Its OK. Keep talking my mother beamed and looked at Pammiji. Both of them gave each other a sly grin. They winked at each other and then folded their hands and looked up to thank God. Dolly looked at my mother and smiled. Auntyji tea she asked. No ji we dont make our daughters work my mother said. The work in this case being screaming at the servant. Raju get tea Dolly exerted herself and earned affectionate glances from my mother. Why couldnt my mother give Ananya one just one glance like that Son tea Pammi aunty offered me. I shook my head. You young people have coffee I know. Should we get coffee Or wait what is that new place at the District Centre Dolly Where they sell that expensive coffee Barsaat Barista mom. Dolly switched to a more anglicized accent when asked to describe something trendy. Yes that. Take his there in the Honda. See ji we are quite modern actually she said to my mother. Modern is good ji. We are also not oldfashioned. Go Krish enjoy my mother said. Of course hating Tamilians is not oldfashioned at all. I stood up to partly enjoy myself with Dolly but mainly to get away from here and ride in the new Honda. DX www.desibbrg.com Come here Dolly Pammiji said and did the unthinkable. She slid a hand into her bosom ATM and pulled out a wad of notes. I wondered if Pammi auntys cleavage also contained credit cards. Dolly took the wad and put it in her golden handbag without counting it. She screamed at the servants to scream at the driver to scream at the security guard to open the gate so the Honda could be taken out. We reached the District Centre a ghetto of salwarkameez shops beauty parlours and STD booths. Dolly insisted on going to her favourite clothes boutique. I watched her choose clothes for half an hour. I wondered if it would be appropriate to call Ananya form one of the STD booths. I dropped the idea and hung around the shop watching Punjabi mothers and daughters buy salwar kameezes by the dozen. The daughters were all thin and the mothers were all fat. The boutique specialised in these extreme sizes. Healthy figure range is there one salesman said as he pointed a mother to the right direction. Dolly finished her shopping and paid for three new suits with her wad of notes. You like these she asked opening her bag. Nice I said as we entered Barista. The airconditioning and soothing music were a respite from the blazing fortydegree sun outside. One cold coffee with icecream Dolly said. What do you want I ordered the same and we sat on the couch sitting as far apart as possible. We mutely stared at the music channel on the television in front of us. Ive never spoken to an IITian before she said after some time. You are not missing much I said. She shifted in her seat. Her clothes bag fell down. She lifted it back up. Sorry I get nervous in front of hifi people she said. Dont be I said. Enjoy your coffee. You have a girlfriend no South Indian DX www.desibbrg.com What I jumped off my seat. Who told you Kittu told me she said. Kittu was my first cousin and Shipra masis daughter. Kittus father was Pammi auntys cousin. In some sense Dolly was my third or fourth cousin though we werent related by blood. Kittu How did she know Shipra masi must have told her. And your mother must have told Shipra masi. And now the whole clan knows I guessed. Sort of. What else do you know about her Nothing Dolly said as her eyes shifted around. Tell me. Oh some stuff. That she is very aggressive and clever and has you totally under control. But South Indian girls are like that no Do you know any South Indian girls No Dolly said as she twirled her straw. Sorry I didnt want to tell you. You guys serious or is it just timepass I tried to curb my anger. What about you You have a boyfriend No no. Never she swore. Not even timepass She looked at me. I smiled to show friendliness. Just one colony guy. Dont tell my mom please. Or your mother or even Kittu. I won. He sent me a teddy bear on Valentines day. Cute I said. Have you kissed anyone she asked. Like this South Indian girl. DX www.desibbrg.com I thought hard about how I should answer her question without saying the truth that I loved with Ananya in one tiny hostel room for two years. No I said. OK because this guy is insisting I kiss him. But I dont want to get pregnant. How did you meet him Its a very sweet story. He called a wrong number at my home one day. And we started talking. Ive only met him once. You are seeing someone who called a wrong number Hes not my boyfriend yet. But you know I have a didi in Ludhiana who married a guy who called her as a wrong number. They have two kids now. Wow I said. I wondered if I should gulp my coffee down so we could leave sooner. Do you like me Dolly asked. What You know why we have been sent here right For matchmaking. Dolly I cant marry anyone but Ananya. Oh thats her name. Nice name. Thanks and she is nice too. And I am involved. I am sorry my mother dragged me into this. But you said you havent even kissed her. I lied. We lived together for two years. But please dont tell anyone this. Lived together Her eyebrows peaked. Like together You mean you have done everything Thats not important. I only told you so you dont feel bad about my lack of interest in you. Two years She didnt get pregnant Dolly stop. Thanks for the coffee. I can make you forget her Dolly said as she opened out her waist length hair. DX www.desibbrg.com What I know what guys want. You dont. And try to stay away from wrong numbers. We left Barista and drove back in her spacious Honda. I realised this Honda could be mine if only I didnt believe in stupid things like love. What should I tell my mother Dolly asked. Say you didnt like me. Why Shell ask. Its easy to slam an IITian down. Say I am a geek boring lecherous whatever I said. She doesnt understand all that Dolly said. OK tell her Krish has no plans to continue in the bank. Hell quit in a few years to be a writer. Writer Yes. You are too hifi for me she said as we reached her house. DX www.desibbrg.com I cant believe you said no to Dolly my mother said. There has to be a reason no She had brought up the topic for the twentieth time three days later. My father didnt come home until late so my mother had taken the risk and invited her sister home for lunch. Some Indian men cannot stand any happiness in their wives lives which includes her meeting her siblings. Pammi is buying one more house in the next lane. She told me it is for her daughter Shipra masi said rubbing salt into my mothers wounds. My mother hung her head low. You are making the same mistake again. You chose an army person for your own marriage. You said they are sacrificing people. We have seen how much. You have spent your whole life in misery and poverty. My mother nodded as she accepted her elder sisters observation. Shipra masi had married rich. Her husband a sanitaryfittings businessman had struck gold building toilets. My mother had valued stupid things like virtue education and nature of profession and suffered. And according to Shipra masi I planned to do the same. How much will that Madrasin earn Shipra masi inquired. Dolly would have filled your house. When was the last time you bought anything new Look even your dining table shakes. Shipra masi banged on the dining table and its legs wobbled. I pressed the top with my palm to neutralize her jerks. I say meet Pammi once again and close it Shipra masi suggested. What are you thinking she said after a minute. Do you know Pammi bought the phone the one you can walk around with everywhere Cordless. My mother said. Not cordless the new costing twenty thousand rupees. You can take it all over Delhi. Pass me the pickle Shipra masi said. She ate up fast to catch up the lost time she spent on her monologue. DX www.desibbrg.com Cellphones had recently arrived in India. A minutes talktime cost more than a litre of petrol. Needless to say it was the newest Punjabi flaunt toy in Delhi. And what is this writer thing Dolly said you will leave the bank to be a writer one day. What my mother gasped. In time after I have saved some money I said and picked up my plate to go to the kitchen. This is what happens if you educate children too much my masi said. I have no idea of him becoming a writer. When did this start my mother turned to me as I returned from the kitchen. The South Indian girl must have told him. They love books Shipra masi said. I banged my fist on the table. The legs wobbled. Maybe we did need to change it. Nobody asked me to be a writer. Anyway it is none of your business Shipra masi. Look at him these black people have done their black magic Shipra masi said. Dont be foolish Kavita tell Pammi he will remain in Citibank and make a lot of money. Get his price properly. I glared at everyone at the table went to the livingroom sofa and picked up the newspaper. The matrimonial page opened out. I threw it in disgust. Lets look at some educated girls. You want to see educated girls my mother threw a pacifier at me. I have an educated girl. I like her. She has a job she is pretty decent hardworking and has a lot of integrity. What is your problem Son Shipra masi said her voice soft for reconciliation that is all fine. But how can we marry Madrasis Tomorrow your cousins will want to marry a Gujarati. Or Assamese my mother added. My god Shipra masi said. So what Arent they all Indians Cant they be good human beings I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Shipra masi turned to my mother. Your son is gone. I am sorry but this boy belongs to Jayalalitha now. The bell rang twice. Panic spread in the house as my father had arrived earlier than usual. I never welcome my father home. However I was happy as it meant Shipra masi would leave now. Hello Jijaji Shipra masi said as my father entered the house. My father didnt answer. He picked up the newspaper thrown on the floor and folded it. I said hello Jijaji Shipra masi said and smiled. She didnt give up easily. I like your goodbye more than hello my father replied. No one can beat him in the asshole stakes. My sister has invited me Shipra masi said. Useless people invite useless people my father said. Shipra masi turned to my mother. I dont come here to get insulted. Only you can bear him. The worst decision of your life Shipra masi mumbled as she packed her handbag to leave. I would appreciate it if you dont interfere in our family matters my father said and gave her a brown bag. It was mithai Shipra masi had brought for us. They exchanged glares. Take it or I will throw it in the dustbin my father said. I stood up to argue. My mother signalled me to back off. Shipra masi reached the main door. I came with her to shut it. I touched her feet more out of ritual than respect. Son now dont make foolish decisions like your mother. Marry a good Punjabi girl before they find out about your father. Dolly is good. My fathers ears are as sharp as his tongue. What is going on Who is Dolly my father shouted. Shipra masi shut the door and left. Nobody answered. Are you seeing girls my father demanded of my mother. My mother kept quiet. DX www.desibbrg.com Did you see a girl Yes I said. I was kind of glad I did just to piss him off. I will. He screamed at my mother lifting his hand. Dont even fucking think about it I came close to him. In this house I make the decisions my father said. He picked up a crystal glass and smashed it on the floor. The violence intended at my mother had to come out somehow. You sure seem mature enough to take them I said and moved towards kitchen. Dont walk barefoot my mother called out. She bent to pick up the splintered shards. Anger seethed within me. Not only at my father but also my mother how could she let him get away with this and start cleaning up calmly I dont know why I come to this house my father said. I was thinking the same thing I said. Bastard mind it he shouted at me like he did at his army jawans ten years ago. Krish go to the other room my mother said. He cant be my son. Nobody talks to their father like this. And no father behaves like this I said. My mother pushed me towards the bedroom. My father looked around for new things to shout at or break. He couldnt find much. He turned around and walked out. The loud sound of the door banging shut sent a sigh of relief through the whole house. My mother came to my room after cleaning up the glass in the living area. She came and sat next to me on the bed. I didnt look at her. She held my chin and turned my face towards her. DX www.desibbrg.com You let him do this so he does it. Why did you have to start cleaning up I sulked. Because hell break the other glasses too. And then we will have no more glasses left for guests my mother said. Dont worry. I can manage him. I looked at my mother a tear rolled down her eye. I flt my eyes turn wet too. You have to leave him I said after we composed ourselves. Its not that simple she said. I will earn now I said. I am fine. Ninety percent of the time he is not even here. He goes to his army mess he visits his partners with whom he tries his harebrained business schemes. What Like that security agency I scoffed. Yes but he picks up fights with customers at the first meeting. Doesnt exactly make them feel safe my mother said. I laughed. I can handle him. It is you who gets angry and fights with him my mother said. He starts it. What was the need to insult Shipra masi He wont change. Shipra is used to him. I worry how you will stay with him when you work in Delhi. Maybe you should take the company accommodation. Or maybe I should not be in Delhi. What are you saying I cant stand him. Where are you planning to go I dont know mom. I can only give a preference to Citibank. Its no guarantee. Plus you get posted out after two years. You chose Delhi no DX www.desibbrg.com I didnt answer. Somehow the thought of being in Delhi and seeing ditzy Punjabi girls by day and dad at night didnt seem terribly exciting. You come with me wherever I go I said. Where I cant leave Delhi. All my relatives are here. You will be in office all day. What will I do in a new city I want to go to Chennai I said. Oh God my mothers mellow mood shifted gears to overdrive. She got up from the bed. I find this harder to deal with than your father. Are you mad No I like Ananya. I want to give our relationship a shot. Youll become a Madrasi I am not becoming. Im only going there to live. And Citibank transfers you in two years. I should meet an astrologer. I dont know what phase you are going through. There is no phase. I love someone. Love is nothing son my mother patted my cheek and left the room. I didnt submit the Citibank form until the last date. I kept taking my pen to the location preference question. It had asked for three choices in order. I couldnt fill it. Youve sent your form Ananya asked on the phone. I will. Almost ready I said Are you crazy It is the last day. You put Chennai right Yeah I said and hung up. I gave one final glance at the form. I looked at God above and asked him to decide my lovelife. I filled up the form DX www.desibbrg.com Location Preference . Chennai or Delhi equal preference . . I sealed the form and dropped it off at the bank branch. In my bed I opened Ananyas letter from last week. I read it every night before going to bed. Hello my Punjabi hunk Miss me I do. I miss our cuddles I miss our walks in campus I miss studying together and then going for midnight chai I miss running to my dorm every morning to brush my teeth I miss eating paobhaji on the char rasta with you I miss playing footsie in the library I miss the glances we stole in the class I miss my bad grades and the tears afterwards that you wiped I miss how you used to watch me put eyeliner I miss..oh you get the drift I miss you like hell. Meanwhile I am fine in Chennai. My mother is at her neurotic best my father is quiet as usual and my brother always has a book that says Physics Chemistry or Maths on the cover. In other words things are normal. I mentioned you again to my mother. She called a priest home who gave me a pendant to make me forger you. Wow I never thought theyd react to you like this. Well it is going to take more than a pendant to forget you but for good measure I tossed it into the Bay of Bengal on Marina Beach. I havent mentioned you since because I know you will come to Chennai and charm them yourself just as you charmed me. Bye my Love Ananya. PS Oh did I mention I miss the sex too. I read the letter ten times. I read the last sentence a hundred times. I wanted to be with her right that moment. I realised I could have written Chennai in the form but I had played roulette with my lovelife due to some vague sense of responsibility and guilt towards home. I wondered if Citi would need more people in Delhi as this is where all the money is. After all a Punjabi is far more likely to DX www.desibbrg.com want foreign bank accounts than a Tamilian. And I am a Punjabi so they would give me Delhi. Something yelped inside me. I read the letter again and again until I fell asleep. One week later I received a call at home. Mother picked it up and said it was from a guy who sounded like a girl. Hello I said. Hi Krish its Devesh from Citi HR. Oh hi Devesh. How are you Good I just wanted to give you your joining date and location. My heart started to beat fast. Yes I said excited and nervous. So you start on June . OK. And we are placing you in Chennai. Imaginary fireworks exploded all over the Delhi sky. I felt real love for Devesh the HR department and Citibank for the first time in my life. DX www.desibbrg.com Act Chennai DX www.desibbrg.com My flight landed in Chennai at p.m. we had a sixhour delay in Delhi because a psycho called the airport and said the plane had a bomb. My bag took another hour to arrive on the conveyor belt. As I waited I looked at the people around me. The first thing I noticed excuse my shallowness was that almost ninety percent of the people were dark complexioned. Of these ninety percent eighty percent had dabbed talcum that gave them a grey skin tone. I understood why Fair Lovely was invented. I couldnt understand why people wanted to be fair so bad. Most women at the conveyor belt looked like Ananyas mother I couldnt tell one from the other. They all wore tones of gold but somehow it looked more understated than Pammi auntys necklaces that had precious stones and pearls hanging from them like shapeless dry fruits. I came out of the airport. I had to find an auto to go to my chummery. I fumbled through my pockets to find the slip of paper with my new address. I couldnt find them in my jeans and almost panicked. I didnt know any place in Chennai except T. Nagar. And I knew t. Nagar as I took Brilliant Tutorials once upon a time. Somehow I didnt think theyd shelter one of their lakh of students from eight years ago. I opened my wallet and found my address. I heaved a sigh of relief. I came to the auto stand. Four drivers argued with each other over the next passenger. Enga one driver pushed back three drivers and asked me. Enga hotel No hotel I said and took out my wallet. I opened it and the drivers saw the ten hundredrupee notes my mother had given me before leaving Delhi. He smacked his lips. I pulled out the slip with the address. English illa he said. I looked around. No one proficient in English seemed visible. I read the address. Nungbakamama I said. Nungambakkam the driver laughed as if it was the easiest word to say in the world. DX www.desibbrg.com Yeah I said and remembered a landmark Devesh had told me. Near Loyola College. You know Loyola College. Seri seri the driver said. My stay with Ananya had told me that Seri meant an amiable Tamilian. I loaded the luggage. Meter He laughed again as if I had made a bawdy joke. What I tapped the meter. Meter illa the driver said loudly his personality taking on a more aggressive form as he left the airport. How much I asked. Edhuvum he said. I dont understand. Stop how much He didnt stop or answer. I tapped his shoulder. He looked back. I played dumb charade with him acting out How much money dude He continued to drive. After ten seconds he raised his right palm and stretched out his five fingers wide. Five what He flashed his fingers again. Fifty He nodded. OK I said. He understood this word. Vokay he said and extended his hand for a handshake. I shook his hand. He laughed and zoomed off into the Chennai sunset. I saw the city. It had the usual Indian elements like autos packed public buses hassled traffic cops and tiny shops that sold groceries fruits utensils clothes or novelty items. However it did feel different. First the sign in every shop was in Tamil. The Tamil font resembles those optical illusion puzzles that give you a headache if you stare at them long enough. Tamil women all of them wear flowers in their hair. Tamil men dont believe in pants and wear lungis even in shopping districts. The city is filled with film posters. The heroes pictures make DX www.desibbrg.com you feel even your uncles can be movie stars. The heroes are fat balding have thick moustaches and the heroine next to them is a ravishing beauty. Maybe my mother had a point in saying that Tamil women have a thing for North Indian men. Hey thats IIT the auto driver said a word which would have led to trouble if he had spoken it in Delhi. I looked at the campus wall that lasted for over a kilometre. The driver recited the names of neighbourhoods as we passed them Adyat Saidapet Mambalam and other unpronounceable names so long they wouldnt fit on an entire row of Scrabble. I felt bad for residents of these areas as theyd waste so much of their time filling the address columns in forms. We passed a giant fiftyfeettall poster as we entered Nungambakkam. The driver stopped the auto. He craned his neck out of the auto and folded his hands. What I gestured. Thalaivar he said pointing to the poster. I looked out. The poster was for a movie called Padayappa. I saw the actors and recognised only one. Rajnikant The auto driver broke into a huge grin. I had recognised at least on landmark in the city. He drove into the leafy lanes of Nungambakkam till we reached Loyola College. I asked a few local residents for Chinappa Towers and they pointed us to the right building. I stepped out of the auto and gave the driver a hundredrupee note. I wondered if I should give him a tenrupee tip for his friendliness. Anju the driver said and opened his palm again. I remained puzzled and realised it when he gestured three times. You want five hundred Are you mad Illa mad the driver said blocking the auto to prevent me from taking out the luggage. I looked at the desolate street. It was only nine but felt like two in the morning in the quiet lane. Two autos passed us by. My driver stopped them. One of the autos had two drivers both sitting in front. The four of them spoke to each other in Tamil their voices turning louder. DX www.desibbrg.com Five hundred one driver who spoke a bit of English turned to me. No five hundred. Fifty I said. Ai another driver screamed. The four of them surrounded me like baddies form a lowbudget Kollywood film. What Just give me my luggage and let me go I said. Illa luggage. Paymentmakeyou the Shakespeare among them spoke to me. They started moving around me slowly. I wondered why on earth didnt I choose to work in an airconditioned office in Delhi when I had the chance. Lets go to the police station I said mustering up my Punjabi blood to be defiant. Illa police screamed my driver who had shaken hands with me just twenty minutes ago. This Chennaihere police is my policethis no North Indiailla police ennoda poola combuda the Englishspeaking driver said. Their white teeth glistened in the night. Any impressions of Tamil men being timid influenced by Ananyas father evaporated as I felt a driver tap my back. Fuck I said as I noticed one of the drivers take out something from his pocket. Luckily it wasnt a knife but a pack of matches and cigarettes. He lit one in style influenced by too many Tamil movies. I looked down the street for anybody anyone who would get me out of this mess. One man came out of the next building. I saw him and couldnt believe it. He had a turban a Sardarji in Chennai was akin to spotting a polar bear in Delhi. He had come out to place a cover on his car. Tingles of relief ran down my spine. Krishna had come to save Draupadi. Uncle I shouted as loudly as I could. Uncle looked at me. He saw me surrounded by the autos and understood the situation. He came towards us. The drivers turned ready to take him on as well. Enna the uncle said. DX www.desibbrg.com The drivers gave their version of the story to him. Uncle spoke to them in fluent Tamil. It is fascinating to see a Sardarji speak in Tamil. Like Sun TVs merger with Alpha TV. Where are you coming from he said. Airport. Airport cannot be five hundred rupees. Hundred maximum he said. The four drivers started speaking simultaneously with lots of illas. However they had softened a little due to uncles Tamil. After five minutes we settled for a hundred bucks and disgusted glances from the drivers. My driver took out my luggage and dumped it on the street as he sped off. Thanks uncle I said. Youve lived in Chennai long Too long. Please dont stay as long as me Uncle said as he helped me with my luggage to the lift. Punjabi I nodded. Come home if you need a drink or chicken. Be careful your building is vegetarian. No alcohol also. Really Yes people here are like that. For them anything fun comes with guilt he said as the lift doors shut. I rang the chummery doorbell. It was ten oclock. A sleepy guy opened the door. The apartment was completely dark. Hi I said. Krish from Delhi. I am in consumer finance. Huh the guy said. Oh you are that guy. The only North Indian trainee in Citibank Chennai. Come in you are so late. Flight delay I said as I came into the room. He switched on the drawingroom light. I am Ramanujan from IIMB he said. I looked at him. Even just out of the bed his hair was oily and combed. He looked like someone who would do well at a bank. With my harried look after the scuffle with the auto drivers I looked like someone who couldnt even open a bank account. DX www.desibbrg.com Thats Sendils room and thats Appalingams. He pointed me to my room. Anything to eat in the house I said. I dont know he said and opened the fridge. there is some curd rice. He took out the bowl. It didnt look like a dish. It looked like rice had accidently fallen into the curd. Anything else Any restaurant open nearby He shook his head as he picked up two envelopes and passed them to me. Here some letters for you. The servant said a girl had come to see you. I looked at the letter. One was the welcome letter from Citibank. The second envelope had Ananyas handwriting on it. I looked at the curd rice again and tried to imagine it as something yummy but I couldnt gather the courage to eat it. I came to my room and lay down on the bed. Ramanujan shut the lights in the rest of the house and went back to sleep. Should we wake you up he had asked before going to his room. What time is office Nine but trainees are expected to be there by eight. We target seventhirty. We wake up at five. I thought about my last two months in Delhi when waking up at nine was an early start. Is there even daylight at five Almost. Well wake you up. Good night. I closed my door and opened Ananyas letter. Hey Chennai boy I came to see you but you hadnt arrived in the afternoon as you told me. Anyways I cant wait any longer as mom thinks I am with friends at the Radha Silks Shop. I have to be back. Anyway there is a bit of drama at home but I dont want to get into that now. Dont worry we shall meet soon. Your office is in Anna Salai not far from mine. However HLL is making me travel a lot all over the state. I have to sell tomato ketchup. Hard considering it has no tamarind or coconut in it DX www.desibbrg.com Ill leave now. Guess what I am wearing jasmine flowers in my hair today It helps to have a traditional look in the interiors. I broke a few petals and have included them in this letter. Hope they remind you of me. Love and kisses Ananya. I opened the folds of the letter. Jasmine petals fell into my lap. They felt soft and smelt wonderful. It was the only thing about this day that made me happy. It reminded me why I was here. DX www.desibbrg.com It is bad news when you hate your job in the first hour of the first day of office. It isnt like Citibank did anything to piss me off. In fact they tried their best to make me feel at home. I already had an assigned cubicle and computer. My first stint involved working in a group that served priority banking clients a politically correct term to address stinking rich customers. There is little a customer needed to do to become priority except wave bundles of cash at us. Priority customers received special service which included sofas for waiting areas instead of chairs free tea while the bank representative discussed new ways to nibbleoops sorry invest clients money. And the biggest touted perk was you would get direct access to your Customer Service Managers. These were supposed to be financial wizards from the top MBA schools who would take your financial strategy to a whole new level. Yes that would be me. Of course we never mentioned that your customer service manager could hate his job do it only for the money and would have come to the city only because his girlfriend was here. I had to supervise eight bank representatives. The bank representatives were younger typically graduates or MBAs from nonblueblooded institutions. And I being from an IIM and therefore injected with a sense of entitlement for life would obviously be above them. I didnt speak Tamil or know anything about banking but I had to pretend I knew what I was doing. At least to my boss Balakrishnan or Bala. Welcome to the family he said as we shook hands. I wondered if he was related to Ananya. Family The Citibank family. And of course the Priority Banking family. You are so lucky. New MBAs would die to get a chance to start straight in this group. I smiled. Are you excited young man Bala asked in a highpitched voice. Superexcited I said wondering if theyd let me leave early as it was my first day. He took me to the priority banking area. Eight reps four guys and four girls read research reports and tips from various departments on what they could see DX www.desibbrg.com today. I met everyone though I forgot their similar sounding South Indian names the minute ii heard them. Customers start coming in at ten two hours from now Bala said. And that is when the battle begins. We believe trainees learn best by facing action. Ready for war I looked at him. I could tell he was a Citibank lifer. At forty he had probably spent twenty years already in the bank. Ready Any questions champ Bala asked again. Yeah what exactly am I supposed to do Bala threw me the first of his many disappointed looks at me. He asked a rep for the daily research reports. Two things you need to do actually three Bala said as he took me to my desk. One read these reports everyday and see if you can recommend any investments to the clients. Like look at this. He pulled out a report from the equities group. It recommended shares of Internet companies as their values had dropped by half. But isnt the dot com bubble bursting I asked. These companies would never make money. Bala looked at me like I had spoken to him in pure Punjabi. See our research has given a buy here. This is Citibanks official research Bala spoke like he was quoting from the Bible. Official research was probably written by hungover MBA three years out of business school. Fine what else The second important job is to develop a relationship. Tamilians love educated people. You being from IIT and IIM must develop a relationship with them. I nodded. I was the endangered species in the prioritybanking zoo that customers could come throw bananas at. Now it is going to be hard for you as you are Bala paused as if he came to a swear word in the conversation. Punjabi Yes but can you befriend Tamilians DX www.desibbrg.com I am trying to. I have to I said wondering where I could call Ananya apart from her home number. If only these damn cellphone prices would drop fast. Good. And the last thing is Bala moved forward to whisper these reps are quite lazy. Keep an eye on them. Anyone not doing their job tell me. He winked at me and stood up to leave. And come to office early. I came at seventhirty. Isnt the official time nine Yes but when I was your level I came at seven. If you want to be like me wake up soldier Bala said and laughed at his own joke. The Tamil sense of humour if there is any is really an acquired taste. I didnt want to be like him. I didnt even want to be here. I took a deep breath after he left and meditated on my salary package. You are doing it for the money I told myself. Four lakh a year that is thirtythree thousand a month I chanted the mantra in my head. My father had worked in the army for thirty years and still never earned half as much. I had to push bubble stocks and the cash would be mine. Life isnt so bad I said to myself. Sir can I go to the toilet one female rep came to me. What She looked at me waiting for permission. Whats your name Sri. Where are you from Coimbatore she said adjusting her oversized spectacles with cockroachcoloured borders. Fashion is not a Chennai hallmark. You went to college Yes sir. Coimbatore University distinction sir. Good. Then why are you asking me for permission Just like that sir. She said. No one needs to ask me permission for going to the toilet I said. Thank you sir. DX www.desibbrg.com I read reports for the next two hours. Each one had financial models done my overenthusiastic MBAs who were more keen to solve equations than to question what they were doing. One table compared value of Internet companies with the number of visitors to the site. The recommended company had the lowest value to eyeball ratio a trendy term invented by the analyst. Hence BUY screamed the report. Of course the analyst never questioned that none of the site visitors ever paid any money to the Internet company. It is trading cheap on every multiple conceivable the report said complete with the exclamation mark. Sir my customer is here. Can I bring them to you Sri requested well after her return from the toilet. Sure I said. Sir this is Ms Sreenivas Sri said. A fiftyyearold lady with gold bangles thicker than handcuffs came to my cubicle. We moved to the sofa area to give a more personal living room feel as we robbed the customer. You are from IIT she peered at me. Yes I said even as I readied my pitch about which lossmaking company to buy. Even my grandson is preparing for it she said. She had dark hair with oil that made it shine more. You dont look old enough to have a grandson preparing for IIT I said. Ms Sreenivas smiled. Sri smiled back at her. Yes we had laid the mousetrap and the cheese. Walk in baby. Oh no I am an old lady. He is only in class six though. How much is madams balance I asked. One crore and twenty lakh sir Sri supplied. I imagined the number in my head Id need to work in this job for thirty years to get there. It almost felt right to part her from her money. Madam have you invested in any stocks Internet stocks are cheap these days I said. Ms Sreenivas gave me a worried look. Stocks Never. And my son works in an Internet company abroad. He said they might close down. DX www.desibbrg.com Thats USA madam. This is India we have one billion population or two billion eyeballs. Imagine the potential of the Internet. And we have a mutual fund so you dont have to invest in any one company. We cajoled Ms Sreenivas for five minutes. I threw in a lot of MBA terms like strategic advantage bottomline vs. top line top down vs. bottom up and it made me sound very intelligent. Ms Sreenivas and Sri nodded at whatever I said. Ultimately Ms Sreenivas agreed to nibble at toxic waste. Lets start with ten lakh I said to close the case. Five. Please five Ms Sreenivas pleaded with us on how to use her own money. I settled at five and Sri was ecstatic I had become their favourite customer service manager. Bala took me out for lunch at Sangeethas a dosa restaurant. What dosas do you have I asked the waiter. We have eightyfive kinds the waiter pointed to the board. Every stuffing imaginable to man was available in dosa form. Try the spinach dosa. And the sweet banana dosa Bala said as he smiled at me like the father I never had. So how does it feel to get your first investment Heart pumping My heart didnt pump. It only ached. Id been in Chennai for fifteen hours and had not spoken to Ananya yet. I wanted to buy a cellphone as soon as possible. Wait Id need two. I see myself in you. You are like me Bala said as he dunked his first piece of dosa in sambhar. I had no clue how he reached that conclusion. I had Ananyas home landline number. But she didnt reach home until seven. She had a sales field job so no fixed office number as well. I remembered how wed finish lunch in campus and snuggle up for our afternoon nap. It is official life after college sucks. Isnt this fun Bala said. I get a rush every time I come to the bank. And it is twenty years. Wow I still remember the day my boss first took me out for lunch. Hey what are you thinking Stop work thoughts now. It is lunchtime. Of course I said and collected myself. How far is HLL office from here DX www.desibbrg.com Why You have a potential client Bala asked as if the only reason people existed was to become priority banking customers. Possibly I said. One good thing about banking is that you dont feel bad about lying at all. It is in Nungambakkam. Apex Plaza he said. The waiter reloaded our sambhar and delivered the banana dosa. The latter tasted like a pancake and I have to say wasnt bad at all. Oh thats where I am staying right Yes the Citi chummery. My first home too he leaned forward and patted my back. I suppose I had a good boss. I should have felt happy but didnt. I wondered if I should call HLL first or straight land up there. I came back to my desk in the afternoon. I met some customers but most of them didnt have time to stay long. Ms Sreenivas had given me a lucky break but it wasnt that easy to woo conservative Tamilians after all. Fixed deposit. I like fixed deposit one customer told me when I asked him for his investment preferences. At three in the afternoon I had a call. It is for you sir Sri said as she transferred the line to my extension. Hi Id like to open a priority account with my hotshot sexy banker. Ananya I said my voice bursting with happiness Where are you When are we meeting Should I come to HLL I am sorry my flight Easy easy. I am in Kancheepuram. Wheres that Three hours from Chennai. Ill head back soon. Why dont you come home for dinner Home Your home With your mom and dad Yes why not You have to know them anyway. Moms a little low these days but that is OK. Why is she low Because of us DX www.desibbrg.com No she finds other reasons to be miserable. Luckily this time it has nothing to do with me. Ananya lets go out OK I cant today. My aunt is visiting from Canada. Come at eight. She gave me her address. I noted it down after making her spell it thrice. See you in five hours she said and hung up. I stared at the watch hoping it would move faster. The reps left at six and as Citis great culture goes MBAs never left until eight. I killed time reading reports on the Indian economy. Smart people had written them and they made GDP forecasts for the next ten years with confidence that his the basic fact how can you really tell dude At seventhirty I stood up to leave. Bala came towards me. Leaving he asked puzzled as if I had planned to take a half day. Yeah I said. Not much to do. One tip never leave before your boss he said and winked at me. He laughed and I didnt find it funny at all. I want to see what a Tamil joke book looks like. What time do you leave I said tired. Soon actually let me call it a day. Kusum will be waiting. You want to come home for dinner No thanks I said. He gave me the second disappointed look. I have to go somewhere distant relatives I said. Oh he said his voice still a little sad. I am sorry dude I am not handing you the remote of my life because you are my boss I thought. DX www.desibbrg.com Swaminathan the name plate of Ananyas small standalone house proclaimed in arched letters. I pressed the doorbell even as a buzzing grinder drowned the ring. Yes Ananyas father opened the door with a puzzled expression. I bet he recognised me but feigned ignorance to rattle me. He wore a halfsleeve white vest with a front pocket and a checked blue and white lungi. Krish sir Ananyas friend I said. For no particular reason fear makes me address people as sir. I had brought a gift pack of biscuits as my Punjabi sensibilities had taught me to never go to someones house without at least as many calories as you would consume there. Oh come in he said after I reintroduced myself. I stepped inside and handed him the gift pack. Shoes he said in a stern voice when I had expected thanks. What I said. He pointed at the shoe rack outside the house. I removed my shoes and checked my socks for smells and holes. I decided to take them off too I went inside. Dont step on the rangoli he warned. I looked down. My right foot rested on a rice flour flower pattern. Sorry I am really sorry sir I said and bent down to repair the pattern. Its OK. It cant be fixed now he said and ushered me into the living room. The long rectangular room looked like what would be left if a Punjabi drawing was robbed. The sofas were simple with cushions thinner than Indian Railways sleepers had and from the opposite of the decadent red velvet sofas Pammi aunty. The walls had a pale green distemper finish. There were pictures of various South Indian gods all around the room. The dining area had floor seating. At one corner there was a daybed with a tambura which looks like a sitar kept on it. An old man sat there. I wondered if Ananyas parents were cool enough to arrange live music for dinner. Sit Ananyas father said pointing at the sofa. DX www.desibbrg.com We sat opposite each other as I faced Ananyas dad for the first time in my life. I strained my brain hard for a suitable topic. Nice place I said. What is nice No water in this area uncle said as he picked up a newspaper. I hung my head as if to apologise for the water problem in Mylapore. Ucle opened the newspaper which blocked his face from mine. I didnt know if it was intentional. I kept quiet and turned to the man with the tambura. I smiled but he didnt react. The house had an eerie silence. A Punjabi house is never this silent even when people sleep at night. I bent forward to see if uncle was reading the paper or avoiding me. He had opened the editorial page of The Hindu. He read an opinion piece about AIADMK asking the government to do an enquiry on the defense minister who had sacked the naval chief. It was heavyduty stuff. No one in my family correction no one in my extended clan ever read editorial pages of newspapers let alone articles about AIADMK. Uncle caught me peeking over him and grunted What Nothing I said. I didnt know why I felt so guilty. Uncle continued to read for five minutes. I had an opportunity to speak again when he turned the page. No one is at home sir Where will they go I cant see anyone. Cooking. Cant you hear the grinder he said. I didnt know if Ananyas father was naturally like this or extra grumpy today. Maybe he is pissed about me being here I thought. You want water he said. No sir I said. Why Why you dont want water I didnt have an answer except that I felt scared and weird in this house. OK give me water I said. Radha uncle screamed. Tanni Is that Ananyas grandfather I said pointing to the old man. DX www.desibbrg.com No he said. I realised Ananyas father answered exactly what was asked. Who is he I asked slowly. Its Radhas Carnatic music teacher who came to see her. But she is busy in the kitchen making dinner for you. Now what to do I nodded. Ananyas mother came in the living room. She held a tray with a glass of water and a plate of savouries. The spiralshaped browncoloured snacks resembled fossilised snakes. Hello aunty I stood up. Hello Krish she said. I am sorry I came at the wrong time I said looking at the teacher. Its OK. Ananya invited you. And she has a habit of not consulting me Ananyas mother said. Aunty we can all go out I said. Its OK. Food is almost ready she said and turned to her husband. Give me half an hour with Guruji. She went up to Guruji and touched his feet. The Guruji blessed her. Ananyas mother picked up the tambura and they left the room. So Citibank placed you in Chennai uncle said initiating conversation with me for the first time. Yes sir I said. Ananya had told him the bank transferred me. Why do they send North Indians here I dont know sir. Useless buggers he mumbled and buried himself in his newspaper again. I cleared my throat and finally gathered the courage to ask. Wheres Ananya Uncle looked up in shock as if I had asked him where he kept his porn collection. She had gone for a bath. She will come after evening prayers. DX www.desibbrg.com I nodded. Ananya never did any evening prayers in Ahmedabad. I heard noises from the other room. They sounded like long wails as if someone was being slowly strangled. I looked puzzled and uncle looked at me. Carnatic music uncle said. You know I shook my head. Then what do you know he asked and sank into The Hindu waiting for me to respond. I had an urge to run out of the house. What the fuck am I doing here in this psycho home I heard footsteps outside. Sorry Ananya said coming in. I turned to look at her. I was seeing her after two months. She wore a creamcoloured cotton sari with a thin gold border. She seemed prettier than I last saw her. I wanted to grab her and plant the biggest kiss on her lips ever. Of course things had to be different with Mr Hinduaddict Grumpyswami in front of me. Hi Ananya good to see you I greeted her like a colleague at work. I kept my hands close to my body. What Give me a hug she said and uncle finally lost interest in The Hindu. Sit here Ananya he said and carefully folded the newspaper like he would read it again every day for the rest of his life. Hi dad Ananya said and kissed her father on the cheek. I felt jealous. Oh mom is singing she said upon hearing her mother shriek again. Yes finally Ananyas father said. Can you tell the raga Ananya closed her eyes to listen. She looked beautiful but I had to look away as uncle eyed every move of mine. Its malhar definitely malhar she said. Uncle nodded his head in appreciation. How many ragas are there I asked trying to fit in. A thousand yeah dad Ananya said. At least. You dont listen to Carnatic music uncle said to me. DX www.desibbrg.com Not much but it is kind of nice I said. Of course saying I have no fucking clue what you are talking about didnt seem quite right. Mom won two championships at the Tamil Sangam in Kolkata when dad was posted there Ananya said her voice proud. But she has stopped singing since we came to Chennai uncle said and threw up his hands. Why I said. Various reasons Ananya said and gestured at me to change the topic. Your aunt is here I asked. Yes Shobha athai is in the kitchen. She is dads elder sister. I prayed Shobha aunty didnt have a personality like her brothers. Silence fell in the room. I picked up a snack to eat it. Every crunch would be clearly in the room. I had to keep the conversation going. I had read a book on making friends a while ago. It said take an interest in peoples work and keep bringing their name into the conversation. So you have worked all over India Mr Swaminathan I said. A few places until I became stuck here he said. Stuck I thought you like Chennai your hometown I said. Uncle gave me a dirty look. I wondered if I had said something inappropriate. Ill get Shobha. Lets eat dinner soon uncle said and left the room. I wanted to ask Ananya about her father but I wanted to grab her first. Dont Ananya said as she sensed my intentions. What Dont move. Keep a threefeet distance she said. Are you mad There is no one here. Not here My mother is singing in the next room for Gods sake. Thats singing DX www.desibbrg.com Shut up she giggled. And Id suggest you learn a bit of Carnatic music. No stop dont get off the sofa. She gave me a flying kiss and I subsided back into the sofa. Dad is having a bad month at the bank Ananya whispered. He got passed over for promotion. He deserved to head Bank of Baroda for his district but dirty politics happened. And he hates politics. I didnt mention the interest with which he read the AIADMK article. Where is your brother He slept already. He wakes up early to study. We heard footsteps. Be careful with Shobha aunty. Speak minimum she said. Why I said as Ananyas mother came to the living room again. She and her guru walked towards the main door. Aunty had a disappointed expression. Illa practice the guru mumbled as Ananyas mother spoke to him in Tamil. The guru shook his head and left. What Ananya asked her. Nothing. Where is your appa and athai Lets eat Ananyas mother said in a serious tone. Ananyas father and aunt came to the living room. They carried more dishes than their arms were designed for. I stood up to help. Hello aunty can I take something Wash your hands uncle told me and pointed me to the kitchen. We sat on the floor for dinner. Ananyas father passed me a banana leaf. I wondered if I had to eat it or wipe my hands with it. Place it down it is the plate Ananya whispered. Radha Shobha aunty said in a stern voice as she pointed to her banana leaf. It had specks of dirt on one side. Oh sorry sorry Radha aunty said and replaced it. It wasnt different from Shipra masi finding faults with my mother. Psycho relatives are constant across cultures. DX www.desibbrg.com I followed Ananya as she loaded her plate with rice sambhar funnylooking vegetables and two kinds of brown powders. Whats this I asked. Gunpowder try it she said. I tasted it. It felt like sawdust mixed with chillies. Yummy no I nodded at Ananya. Everyone first kept neat little lumps of dishes on their banana leaf. Soon they mixed it into a slurry heap. Mix more Ananya said as I tried to copy my inlawstobe. You are Ananyas classmate Shobha aunty spoke for the first time. Yes at IIM I said. IIT student I nodded. Ananya had told me that my IIT tag was the only silver lining in my otherwise outcast status in their family. Sushilas cousin is also from IIT. Radha I told you no Harish lives in San Francisco. Which batch I asked. IIT Madras not your college Shobha aunty said pissed off at being interrupted. I kept quiet and looked at the various vegetables trying to recognize them. I said hello to beans and cabbage. Harishs parents want to get him married. You have Ananyas nakshtram Shobha aunty said. No not yet Ananyas mother said. What swami Your wife is not interested in finding a good soninlaw I couldnt believe they were discussing all this in my presence. Can you pass the rice I said hoping to steer the conversation elsewhere. DX www.desibbrg.com Radha you must listen to Shobha. She knows best Ananyas father said. Indian men slam their wives for their sisters with zero hesitation. Ananyas mother nodded as Shobha aunty started to discourse in Tamil. Ananyas dad and mother also responded in Tamil. It was irritating to watch a regional language movie in front of me. After five minutes I spoke again. Excuse me What Ananyas father said. Can you speak in English I cant follow the conversation I said. Ananya looked at me shocked. Back off her eyes said. Then learn Tamil Ananyas father said. Yes sir I said meekly. Anyway this doesnt concern you he added. I nodded. I heard various technology companies the boys names. I felt like upturning my banana leaf on Shobha auntys face. I left soon after dinner. Ananya came outside to help me get an auto. Ananya held my arm as we came on the desolate street. I am not talking to you I said and extracted my hand from her. What she said. We passed by a bungalow with coconut trees in the garden. They are planning your marriage. What the hell is nakshtram I said. Its the astrological chart. They are fantasizing. I am not getting married to anyone else but you. She held up my hand and kissed it. I extracted it again. I hailed an auto. Ananya would have to negotiate with him in Tamil else Id have to pay double. How am I going to win them over It is impossible to get through. Sitting with your father is like being called to the principals office. Ananya laughed. Its not funny. DX www.desibbrg.com It is a little. What about my mom I used to be scared of her pictures in campus. Forget her in real life Her looks alone kill me. Her pictures scared you Yes that is why I never wanted to make love in your room. Id notice your mothers pictures and chills ran down my spine. Id imagine her saying What are you doing with my daughter Ananya laughed again. If we werent in Mylapore Id have kissed you. You are so cute she said. Cut it out Ananya what is our plan Will you speak to your mother Moms stressed out. Her Carnatic teacher refused to teach her. Why Ill tell you later. Can we meet tomorrow Outside please I said. Meet me at Marina beach at six she said. I cant do six. My extracaring boss Bala leaves at eight. I didnt say evening. Six in the morning I gulped. Ananya had already turned to the auto driver. Nungambakkam twenty rupees extra illai OK she told him. DX www.desibbrg.com The beautiful sunrise at Marina Beach compensated for the a.m. wake up call. Hundreds of people took a morning walk along the seashore which ran down miles. Do you know this is the biggest city beach in Asia Ananya asked as she met me at the police headquarters building. Youve told me I said. Why are you in formals I go straight to work. Trainees are expected to be there at seventhirty I said removing my shoes and folding my pants up to walk along the beach. To do what To suck up to the boss who if you do a good job will promote you to the next level of sucking up. Welcome to corporate life I said. I am not facing it yet. I have to sell a thousand bottles of ketchup every week. I am so behind my targets. Youd better ketchup fast I said. Funny she said and punched me. Ananya saw a man with a bicycle. He carried a basket full of idlis. Breakfast she offered. Dont they have toast Dont grumble she said. We took four idlis and sat on a bench facing the water. She spoke about her mother. Guruji didnt accept mom. He felt she isnt dedicated enough. But isnt she really good I asked not that I could tell from the shrill cries I heard last night. She isnt good enough by Chennai standards. Dad used to be posted in towns outside Tamil Nadu. Mom became a star in the Tamilian community there. Here she is just OK. Chennais Carnatic music scene is at a different level. I nodded as if I understood. DX www.desibbrg.com My parents came to Chennai with great enthusiasm. But now dad lost his promotion. Pesky relatives visit us all the time. Amidst all this their daughter wants to impose a nonBrahmin nonTamil Punjabi boy on them. Of course they will freak out. We have to be patient. I love them too Krish she said and paused for breath. A gentle breeze blew on our faces. She laid her head on my left shoulder. I stroked her hair. The sun emerged out of the Bay of Bengal a soft red at first turning into a warmer orange. I put my arm around Ananya. In my tie and formal pants I looked like a salesman with no place to take his girlfriend to make out. there is only one way you can get regular access to my home Ananya said after staring at the horizon for a minute. What IIT tuitions for my brother. Theyd accept anything for that she said. I let go of her and sat up straight. Are you crazy I prepared for the IIT exam eight years ago. I cant teach him. Im sure you can revise some notes and help him. My parents have to get comfortable with you. Only then can I ask them to seriously consider you. I dipped my idli into coconut chutney and ate it. I missed my mothers hot paranthas at breakfast. Do you love me She wiped a bit of chutney from my lips. I kissed her. I was kissing her after two months. I didnt release her for a minute. Id revise IIT chemistry for this chemistry any day. Ai a hoarse voice screamed behind us. I turned around. A potbellied Tamilian cop looking more villain than police walked fast towards us. What is this he said and slammed his stick on the bench. Both of us sprang up. Ananya hid behind me. Oh fuck she said. Get rid of him. The cop screamed at me in Tamil. Helpless I asked Ananya to translate. He wants to take us to the police station. He is saying we have some nerve doing all this outside police headquarters. Why do they have police headquarters opposite a beach I asked. DX www.desibbrg.com Shut up and pay him off she whispered. I took out my wallet and took out twenty bucks. Illa Illa the cop continued to shout and grabbed my arms. I took out a fifty. He looked at me and Ananya. Warning the cop said as he took the note. Ananya laughed after the cop left us. Its not funny I said as I wore my shoes again and straightened my pants. Can we meet at my chummery please In a while. I travel out of Chennai everyday and come back late she said. Weekend Ill try she said. You will feed me chicken Im dying to have nonveg. and get beer too. OK I promised. My building had vegetarianonly rules but surely they wouldnt notice if I brought something readymade from outside. We sat in our respective autos. She spoke to me from her side window. And Ill speak to my parents about the tuitions. Twice a week at five Five in the morning Why is everyone so eager to wake up in this town Thats when everyone goes for tuitions she said and sped off. I had to wait for two miserable weeks in Chennai until Ananya finally decided to visit my chummery for lunch one Saturday. One weekend Ananyas mother fell ill and Ananya had to cook for the family courtesy a guilt trip from her mother. The food did not come out right as Ananyas culinary experience is limited to making Maggi in my room and making papads with a clothes iron yes it works. This led to another guilt trip from Shobha aunty to Ananyas mother who blamed her for not bringing up her daughter right. The guilt trip percolated down to Ananya who had to take Shobha aunty jewellery and sari shopping the next weekend. Meanwhile I had visited Brilliant Tutorials and bought IIT exam guides. I couldnt believe how tough the course materials were. The only reason I managed DX www.desibbrg.com to study them in the past was because that distracted me from my parents fights. I revised chemistry to prepare for my first class. I also went to my Sardarji neighbor to find out the best way to procure chicken and beers. Who is coming Punjabi friends he asked. Work people I said to stop him from inviting himself. Be careful when you take it up in the lift he said. As he told me I went to the Delhi Dhabha in Nungambakkam less than a kilometre from my house. I triplepacked the tandoori chicken so no smell came out. I went to the governmentapproved liquor shop where they had trouble establishing my age. Are you over twentyfive No but will be soon I said. Then we cant give you the shopkeeper said. Even if I pay ten bucks extra a bottle It is amazing how money relaxes rules around the country. The shopkeeper packed the three bottles in brown paper and I further placed them in a plastic bag so one couldnt make out the shape. Whats in it the liftman asked me as the bottles touched the ground noisily when I placed the packet on the floor. Lemon squash I said. You should have coconut water instead the liftman said. I nodded and reached my apartment. Ramanujan saw me place the bottles in the fridge. whats that He wore a lungi and nothing on top apart from a white thread around his shoulders. Beer I said. Dude you cant get alcohol in this building he said. My girlfriend is visiting me. She likes it I said. You have a girlfriend Ramanujan repeated like I had ten wives. None of my flatmates had a girlfriend. They were all qualified wellpaid Tamil Citibankers who planned to be auctioned off soon by their parents. DX www.desibbrg.com Yes from college I said. My other roommates came to the living room. None of them wore shirts. I shut the fridge to avoid further conversation on the beverages. She is visiting Chennai Sendil said. Will she stay here She cant stay here Appalingam said. She lives in Chennai I said. The boys looked at each other as to who would ask the bellthecat question. Tamilian Ramanujan asked. Yes I said Tamil Brahmin. I added the last two words to let them absorb the shock at once. Wow all of them said in unison. She drinks beer Ramanujan said. Yes I said and upturned the chicken into a bowl. And chicken What kind of Brahmin is this Sendil said. And dude dont get nonveg in this house. Its my house too I said. But rules are rules he said. People in this city loved rules or rather loved to follow rules. Except if you are a cop or a liquor shop attendant or an auto driver. Let it be Sendil Ramanujan said. Thanks I said and placed the chicken in the fridge. And guys please wear shirts when she is here. Ananya came to my place at two oclock. I greeted her politely in the living room. My flatmates exchanged shy glances with each other as she greeted them. Sendil spoke to her in Tamil. Tamilians love to irritate nonTamil speakers by speaking only in Tamil in front of them. This is the only silent rebellion in their otherwise repressed docile personality. When she finally entered my bedroom I grabbed her from behind. Can w eat first I havent had chicken for a month. DX www.desibbrg.com I havent had sex for four months I said but she went out and opened the fridge. You have beer too. Superb she praised and she pulled out a bottle. She offered it to my flatmates they declined. We moved the food and beer to my bedroom. I didnt want my friends outside to witness sin as we finished a full chicken and two beers. And now for dessert I said and came close to her. If I burp dont stop loving me she said as her lips came close to mine. I burped. She slapped me. We kissed and kissed and kissed some more. Our lovemaking was more intense not only because we did it after a long time but also because we were doing it in this stuckup city for the first time. Mr Citibanker there is no train to catch. Slower gentler nexttime Ananya said as we lay back. I sighed as I entered a semitrance state. Ramanujan played Tamil music outside the room. What say something Men just want sex she said and kicked my leg. Yeah thats why Ive agreed to teach your brother at five in the morning. You want to see my chemistry notes I sat up wore my clothes and pulled out tutorials from the drawer. I read these for four hours last night I said. So sweet she said and came forward to kiss my cheek. Dont worry. My parents will soon see how wonderful you are. And then they will love you like I do. Theyll sleep with me I lay down next to her. She elbowed me in my stomach. That hurt I said. Good. She looked into my eyes. Her gaze turned soft. I know the tuitions are hard. My parents are weird people. Youll not give up right I wont give up. I stroked her hair. This is so amazing this intimacy. Isnt it even better than the sex Im not so sure I said and reached a hand to increase the fan speed. DX www.desibbrg.com We never talk. At home my mom and dad they hardly talk. Well talk about the news the food the weather. But we never talk about our feelings. I only do that with you she said. I kept quiet. She sat up to wear her clothes. She picked up the pillows from the floor and placed them back on the bed. I pulled her arm and made her sit down with me again. How come you dont ask me to run away with you she asked. You want me to What if I did ask you to elope I wouldnt know what to do. I dont want to hurt them. I already have by choosing a Punjabi mate but I think we can win them over I want them to smile on our wedding day. Thats how I imagined my marriage since I was a child. What about you I thought for a minute. I dont want to elope I said. Why Its too easy. And that doesnt serve the greater purpose. Ananya stepped off the bed and brought back the leftovers. She took the crumbs of chicken and ate them as we talked. Greater purpose Yes these stupid biases and discrimination are the reason our country is so screwed up. Its Tamil first Indian later. Punjabi first Indian later. It has to end. Ananya looked at me. Go on she coaxed mischievously. I continued National anthem national currency national teams we wont marry our children outside our state. How can this intolerance be good for our country Ananya smiled. Is it the chicken is it the beer or is it the sex What has charged you up so much Flatter me and say it is the sex. Cmon say it she said. Im serious Ananya. This bullshit must end. And how are we making it end Imagine our kids. I have several times. I want them to have my face. Only your eyes she said. DX www.desibbrg.com Not that think about this they wont be Tamil or Punjabi. They will be Indian. They will be above all this nonsense. If all young people marry outside their community it is good for the country. That is the greater purpose. Oh so the reason you sleep with me is for the sake of your country she said. Well in some ways yes. I smiled sheepishly. She took a pillow and launched an attack on my head. And then for the sake of my country we made love again. Open up Krish Ramanujans worried voice and loud bangs on the door woke me from my nap. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya was sleeping next to me and my head hurt from the beer. Ramanujan continued to slam the door. What I opened the door. Ive been knocking for five minutes Ramanujan said. Come out the landlord is here. Landlord Yes be nice to him. Its the last chummery in Nungambakkam. I dont want to be kicked out. What happened I asked. Come out first. I shut the door and wore the rest of my clothes. Ananya I said. Baby Im sleepy she said trying to pull me back into bed. My landlord is here I said. She didnt respond even though I shook her maniacally. Your appa is outside I said. She sprang up on the bed. What Come out. My landlord is here I said. I went to the living room. My flatmates sat on the dining table. Mr Punnu our sixtyyear old landlord gravely occupied the largest chair. His face had a permanently tragic expression. I sat next to him. No one spoke. Hi guys Ananya came out after five minutes. You want tea Ill make some. She started to walk towards the kitchen. Ananya I will see you later I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya looked at me shocked. She tuned into the mood on the dining table. Ill leave now. She picked up her bag. Mr Punnu stood up after Ananya left the house. He sniffed hard. He peeped into my room. Chicken he frowned. I didnt respond. Beer bottles lay on the bedside table. Ladies he said. She works in HLL I said having no clue why I had to mention her corporate status. Chicken beer lady friends what is going on here he said. Fun I wanted to say but didnt. Those three things are what men live for anyway. Everyone kept quiet. I wondered who had sneaked. My flatmates were no friend material but somehow I didnt expect them to be suck schmucks. Maybe the watchman did it. I didnt expect this from you boys Punnu said in a heavy Tamil accent. Its my fault. I brought the chicken and beer for my girlfriend I said. Girlfriend Punnu said as if I spoke in pure Sanskrit. She is my batchmate. A nice girl I said. Mr Punnu didnt seem impressed. Shes Tamil Brahmin I said. And you Punjabi I said and my head hung low a little by default. How is she a nice girl if she is roaming around with you Mr Punnu asked. He had a valid point. I decided to change the topic. Mr Punnu this is not a boarding school. We are all professionals and what we do in our own home Mr Punnu banged his fist on the table. This is my home he pointed out. Yes but you have leased it to us. Technically we have a right to not let you into the property. DX www.desibbrg.com Mr Punnu looked aghast. Ramanujan had to save the situation. He doesnt know Mr Punnu. He is new here. We should have told him it is a veg building and no alcohol. Not even a drop Mr Punnu said. I have not touched it all my life. Mr Punnu looked like he had touched neither wine nor a woman all his life but badly needed to. Apologise Ramanujan told me. I glanced around. Tamils gathered around me like the LTTE. I had no choice. Im sorry I said. No ladies from now on. Mr Punnu wagged a finger. And beer and chicken I said. That wasnt allowed from before anyway Sendil said. Everyone around me nodded as they felt the warm fuzzy feeling of having set rules on how to live their life. I wondered where Id take Ananya the next time. DX www.desibbrg.com I am good at chemistry. I need help in physics Manjunath nerdembryo and Ananyas younger brother spoke with eh energy of a rooster. His eyebrows went up and down as he spoke in sync with the three rows of ash on his forehead. I had come for my first class. Ananya had left for Madurai the night before for a weeklong sales trip. My head hurt from waking up early. Ananyas mother had sent coffee to Manjus room. It didnt help. Neither did the fact that I had only read up chemistry. lets revise it anyways I said and opened my sheets. Hydrocarbons he said as he saw my notes. Ive done this thee times. I offered him a problem and he solved it in two minutes. I tried a harder one and he did it in the same time. A tape played in the next room. It sounded like a chorus of women marching towards the army. M.S. Subbulaxmi Manju said noticing my worried expression. Devotional music. I nodded as I flipped through the chemistry books to find a problem challenging enough for the little Einstein. Every Tamilian house plays it in the morning. I wondered if Ananya would play it in our house after we got married. My mother would have serious trauma with that sound. The chants became stronger with every passing minute. What is IIT like he asked. I told him about my former college filtering out all the spicy bits that occurred in my life. I want to do aeronautics Manju said. At his age I didnt even know that word. He took out his physics textbook after an hour. He gave me a problem and I asked for time to solve it. He nodded and read the next chapter. The tutor was being tutored. DX www.desibbrg.com I passed the rest of the hour learning physics from Manju. I stood up to leave. I reached the living room where Ananyas dad was making slow love to The Hindu. Ananya had instructed me to spend as much time with her father as possible. I waited for ten minutes until he finished his article. Yes Nothing I said. I finished the class. Good he said and flipped another page. Hows the bank uncle He glanced up from the newspaper surprised. Which bank Your bank. I cleared my throat. How is your job What he said stumped by the stupidity of the question. What is there in job Job is same. Yes sure I said. I stood for another five minutes not sure of what I should do. I couldnt compete with The Hindu and a fresh one came every day. Ill leave now uncle I said. OK he said. I had reached the door when he called out Breakfast Ill have it in the office. Where is your office Anna Salai I said. Thats on my way. I leave at eightthirty. I can drop you he said. I realised eightthirty would mean Id reach an hour later than my boss. It didnt work for me. But the lift also meant I could be in this house for another two hours and be in the car alone with my fatherinlawincourtship. Thats perfect. I have to reach at the same time I said. Good he said and went back to hhis paper again. DX www.desibbrg.com We sat for breakfast at seventhirty. Ananyas father went to the temple room to pray and came back with the customary three grey stripes on his forehead. I wondered if I should go pray too but wasnt sure how Id explain the three stripes in office along with my lateness. We had idlis for breakfast and Ananyas mother put fifty of them in front of us. We ate quietly. Ananya had told me they never spoke much anyway. The best way to fit in was to never talk. More chutney Ananyas mothers question and my shaking my head was the only insightful conversation we had during the meal. Uncle reversed his Fiat from the garage. He peeked out to look at me several times. I wasnt sure if he wanted to avoid me or make a direct hit. Sit uncle said. I went around the car to sit next to him. Sitting with my girlfriends father in a car brought traumatic memories. I took deep breaths. This is not the same situation play cool I said to myself several times. Uncle drove at a speed of ten an hour and I wondered what reason Id give my boss for not coming to office two hours ago. Autos scooters and even some manualpowered vehicles like rickshaws came close to overtaking us. I wanted to talk but couldnt think of any troublefree topic. I opened my office bag with the dubious Citi never sleeps logo and took out my research reports to read. Dot com stocks had lost last week. The analysts who had predicted that these stocks would triple every hour now claimed the market had gone into selfcorrect mode. Selfcorrect it sounded so intelligent and clever it sort of took out the pain away from people who had lost their life savings. It also made you sound dumb if youd ask why didnt the market selfcorrect earlier Or the more basic what the fuck do you mean by selfcorrect anyway I had two clients who had lost ten lakh each coming to visit me today. With my IIMA degree I had to come up with a sleight of hand to make the losses disappear. the car came to a halt near a red light. You wrote those reports uncle asked. I shook my head. Its the research group I said. Then what you do at the bank he was more rhetorical. Customer service I said not sure how anything I did was service. Asking people to give you their money and scraping away at it wasnt service. DX www.desibbrg.com Do you know how to write those reports he said. The cars behind us began to honk. The Fiat didnt start instantly. Uncle made two attempts in vain. Illa service quality he cursed at his car as he pulled the choke. I kept the reports inside as I became ready to push the car. Fortunately the car started at th e third attempt. I can write them why I said answering his earlier question. Nothing. Stupid joint venture my bank has done. Now they want us to submit a business plan. And that GM has asked me. I can help I screamed like a boy scout. Raascal he said. Huh That GM Verma. In my thirty years at the bank I havent done any report. Now I have to make a pinpoint presentation as well. Powerpoint presentation I asked. Yes that one. Intentionally rascal gave me something I dont understand uncle said. I can help I said. Maybe I had found a way to bond with uncle. No need uncle said his voice serious. He realised he had opened up more than he should have. You get off here uncle said and drove to a road corner. Citibank is hardly hundred metres. I stepped out of the car. I said thanks three times and waved him goodbye. He didnt respond. He put his hand on the gearshift. Dont meet Ananya too much. We are simple people we dont say much. But dont spoil her name in our community he said. Uncle but I know you are classmates and you are helping Manju. We can be grateful we can fed you but we cant let Ananya marry you. DX www.desibbrg.com I stood at the traffic intersection. Autos blared their horns at each other as if in angry conversation. It was hardly the place to convince someone about the most important decision of your life. Uncle but I said again. Uncle folded his hands to before pressing the accelerator. The car started to move. Fuck how do I respond to folded hands I thought. Uncle drove past me. Like a defeated insurance salesman I lifted my bag and walked towards the bank. DX www.desibbrg.com Welcome sir welcome to State Bank of India Bala said. His tone couldnt hide his anger thereby ruining the sarcasm of his lines. He sat on my desk waiting for the exact joyous moment when he could squash me. Im really sorry my auto met with an accident I lied. Your chummery servant said you left at five he said. You called my chummery Its only nine. Isnt that the official time anyway No this is Citibank. Not a public sector bank he said. So people who work here cannot have life I mumbled. What Nothing. Ms Sreenivas is coming at ten today I said. And you havent prepared for it. Have you read the reports Yes I have. But the tricky part is she is down ten lakh. And that is because she believed these reports. So no matter how well I read these reports she wont trust them. Can I sit on my chair I asked. Bala stared at me shocked by my defiance. I took my seat. You told me to push these stocks I said and now our clients are down. Ms Sreenivas is an old lady. She will panic. I want you to be prepared. Prepared for what That she and some other clients too could move funds elsewhere. How How can they This is Citibank Bala said. Because even as the Citi never sleeps we make our customers weep. DX www.desibbrg.com Ms Sreenivas panic mode was entertaining enough to attract bankers from other groups to come to our area. First she spoke to me in Tamil for two minutes. When she realised I didnt know the language she switched to English. You you said this will double. Its down seventy percentaa Ms Sreenivas said. Actually madam the market went into selfcorrection mode I said. I now understood the purpose of complex research terms. They deflect uncomfortable questions that have no answer. But Ive lost ten lakh she screamed. Madam stock market goes up and down. We do have some other products that are less risky I said capitalizing on her misery to sell more. Forget it. I am done with Citibank. I told you to do a fixed deposit. You didnt. Now I move my account to Vysya Bank. My sales rep brought several snacks and cold drinks for her. Ms Sreenivas didnt budge. Madam but Citibank is a much better name than Vysya I said. Give me the account closing documents Ms Sreenivas said. We had no choice. First hour in office strike one. The TV in the reception showed the CNBC channel. Internet stocks had lost another five percent that day. In the next two weeks our most trusting customers hence the most gullible ones to whom we had peddled companies that did nothing more than make a website lost a total of two crore. My own customers losses were limited to the two ladies as I could never sell those companies well anyway. Bala however with his empire of smart people who rip off rich people had to answer country headquarters in Mumbai. I have seven complaints the country head of the customer service group said in a conference call. Sir it is just an overreaction to the volatility Bala said. Dont quote from the research report. Ive read it the country head said. The call ended. Balas face had turned pale. The bosses had decided to visit the Chennai branch. I first thought I imagined it but it was true Bala shivered a little at the news. Mumbai said we shouldnt have marketed Internet stocks to DX www.desibbrg.com individual investors let alone housewives in the first place. Of course they never complained when the commission kept coming in. but now five customers had closed their accounts and one customer had sent a letter all the way to the CEO of Citibank in New York. At my weekly sales meeting I told my sales reps not to sell Chennai customers anything apart from fixed deposits gold and saris. Sir we dont sell saris one of my reps clarified. Sorry I was trying to be funny. We dont sell gold either right We do. Goldlinked deposit sir she said. Yes I didnt even know my groups products. Actually I didnt even know why I was doing this job. I nodded and smiled. In customer service you need to smile more than a toothpaste model. Is it true that Ms Sreenivas lost ten lakh another of my lady customers walked into the bank. She chuckled and sat close to the sales rep to get the full lowdown. Too bad we couldnt give her the details due to confidentiality reasons. We couldnt offer returns but at least we could have given gossip. Maybe that would lure customers. Krish come here Bala came to me like a petrified puppy at seven in the evening. I had packed my Citi never sleeps bag to go back home and sleep. We had our bosses coming in two days. I had spent the last two nights making presentations for them. It was the crappiest most thankless job in Tamil Nadu. No matter how wonderful I made my slides the numbers were so bad wed be screamed at anyway. Last night I had reached home at three and then woke up again at five to reach brotherin law dearest. I didnt want Bala I wanted a pillow. Bala I I stopped midsentence as he had already turned towards his cabin expecting me to follow him. I went into Balas office. He shut the door softly as possible. He drew the blinds and put the phone off the hook. Either he wants to fire me or molest me I though. DX www.desibbrg.com How is it going he whispered quite unnecessarily as people had already left for the day. Fine. I sent you the presentation. You approved right I said. He had given me an OK in the afternoon. The last thing I wanted was another night out. Yeah thats fine. Listen buddy I need a favour from you. Bala had never called me buddy. The room smelt coconutty and fishy. The coconut came from Balas hair the fish from his unspoken intention. What favour I asked without smiling. See Krish this job my career it is everything to me. I have given my life to this bank. I nodded. Come to the point buddy I thought. And you as you will admit arent into it as much as me. Dont take it the wrong way. He was hundred percent right. But when someone tells you to not take it the wrong way you have to take it the wrong way. Besides I had spent the last three nights working hard with only ATM guards for company. I deserved better. That is hundred percent false I said. Im dying from work. I do whatever you want me to do. I sold that crap Internet Easy easy Bala shushed me. There is nobody here. We are not planning a James Bond mission that we have to whisper I said. Corporate types love to pretend their life is exciting. The whispers fistpumping and animated had gestures are all designed to lift our job description from what it really is that of an overpaid clerk. Im not doubting your hard work. But see in corporate life we have to look after each other. What How If he didnt come to the point in two seconds I would slap him. In my imagination I already had. I am your boss so I can look after you anyway. But today you have a chance to look after me. DX www.desibbrg.com I kept quiet. The country manager is coming. They will ask how the Internet stocks sales to housewives came about. I have to take the heat anyway. But if you could Could what I prompted just to make the scumbag say it. He didnt. You want me to take the blame I hazarded a guess. He gave a brief nod. Wow. Thats unbelievable Bala. Im a trainee. Why will they believe me anyway You are from IIMA. It is conceivable you had a big say from early on. And if I say it my career is fucked. No you are a trainee. I have to recommend your promotion. Consider that done anyway. But if I am held responsible I dont get a promotion ever. You are responsible I stared into his eyes. Please Krish Bala said. The bosssubordinate relationship had changed. Bala begged me for help. I realised the power I could hold over him if I gave in. I could come to office like sane people. I could leave early. I could snooze at my desk. OK so maybe my career at the Citi overpaid clerks club would get affected. So what I could have said yes then but I wanted him to grovel some more. I kept quiet. The country manager as it is doesnt like me. He is North Indian. He will forgive you but not me Bala said. I wondered if he would cry. I could have enjoyed the show longer but I also wanted to go home and rest. Ill see what I can do I stood up. Is that a yes Bala said his eyes expectant. Good night sir I said emphasizing the last word. DX www.desibbrg.com My father never calls me. I have no idea why he did that night. I have no idea why he did that night. I wanted to sleep before the misery of tuition and office began all over again. But at eleven that night Ramanujan knocked on the door. What I called out. Since the day Ananya visited I hardly spoke to my flatmates. Theres a call for you. Who is it Even Ananya never called me this late. Your father. Can you ask him not to call at this hour Ramanujan yawned. I froze at the mention of my father. I prayed my mother was OK. Why would he call me Hello Am I speaking to my son I found his addressing me as his son strange. We had never had a onetoone conversation for the last three years. Its Krish I said. Thats my son only no If you say so I said. Silence followed as two STD pulses passed. Im listening he said. To what To whatever my son has to say to me. There isnt anything left to say. Why have you called so late I said in an angry voice. You sent your mother your first salary cheque Yes I said after a pause. Congratulations he said. DX www.desibbrg.com Is mom OK I hope you are not calling me for some guilt trip of yours. Because if mom is not OK I said separating my words with pauses. Your mother is fine. She is proud of you he said. Anything else Hows life Its none of your business I said. Is this the way to speak to your father he shouted. I dont speak to you I said in case you didnt notice. And I am trying to increase communication he said his voice still loud. I could have hung up the phone right then but I didnt want him to take his anger out on my mother. I kept quiet as he ranted about how I had let him down as a son. He didnt say anything he hadnt in the last twenty years. I also knew that once the monologue started it would take a while to stop. I put the phone on the table and opened the fridge. I took out an apple and a bottle of water. I went to the kitchen cut the apple into little pieces and came back. I had two bites and drank a glass of water. Squawks came from the phone receiver. After finishing the apple I picked up the phone. You have no qualities I can be proud of. These degrees mean nothing. Just because you send you mother money you think you can boss around. I think a person like you he was saying when I put the phone down again. I picked it up again after I finished the apple. I said are you listening His voice was trembling. I am I said. Now it is late. Your bill must also be quiet high. May I go to sleep You have no respect. You said that already. Now can we sleep Good night I said. Good night he said and hung up. No matter how mad they are army people still believe in courtesies. I am sure Indian and Pakistani officers wish each other before they blow each others brains off. DX www.desibbrg.com I came back to bed. I didnt want my fathers chapter in my life again. No father is better than a bad father. Plus right now I had to deal with another father who had folded his hands to keep me away from a daughter I so badly wanted to be with. And I have Bala and loser flatmates and psycho landlord and horrible sambhar smells everywhere in this city. A dozen random thoughts spilled out in my brain right before going to bed. These thoughts swarm around like clumsy fishes and my poor little brain begged guys I need some rest. Do you mind But the thoughts didnt go away. Each fish had an attention deficit disorder. The Bala thought showed visions of me jabbing him with something sharp. The Ananyas dad thought made me think about a dozen postfacto one liners I could have said when uncle folded his hands But I love her sir But you should get to know me uncle You realise we can run away you Hindureading loser. Some people are lucky. They lie down close their eyes and like those like those imported dolls your Dubai relatives give you go off to sleep. I have to shut fifty channels in my brain one click at a time. One hour later I had shut the final thought of how Id admit I taught housewives to play with radioactive stocks. DX www.desibbrg.com Ready Bala jollied me with coffee in the morning. Yes Mr Balakrishnan branch head of customer services brought me coffee in a mug. Too bad he didnt carry it in a tray. Doesnt take much preparation to present yourself as stupid I said and took the coffee. I noticed the mug had become wet at the bottom. Bala picked up a tissue from my desk for me. I could get used to this I thought. We met in the conference room two hours later. Bala loaded up the presentation. True to character he had removed my name from the title slide. Like all banking presentations in every department of every bank in India it started with the liberalisation and how it presents tremendous opportunity for India. As you can see the IT space has seen tremendous volatility in the last three months Bala said pointing to a graph that only went down. Our country head Anil Mathur had come on the first flight to Chennai. His day had started bad as he couldnt get a business class seat last minute and had to rub shoulders with the common people. His grumpy expression continued to worsen during the presentation. Anil was forty years old and seen as a young turk on his way up. Citi thrived on and loved the start system. People introduced him as This is Anil MD. He is a star performer. Again there is nothing starry to do in a bank anyway. It is another thing Citi invented to reduce the dullness of our job. However when Anil entered the room some Chennai bankers eyes lit up much like the auto driver who saw Rajnis poster. And that in short has led to the circumstances we are in today Bala said as he ended his hourlong speech. I couldnt believe he tagged his talk this short. Anil didnt respond. He looked around the room. Chennai trainees avoid eye contact anyway especially when it comes to authority. He looked at Bala and Bala looked at me. I nodded Id be the suicide mission today. Anils cellphone rang. He took it out of his pocket. His secretary had called from Mumbai. DX www.desibbrg.com What do you mean waitlisted for business class I am not coming back like I did this morning sitting cramped with these Madrasis. Apart from me and Anil everyone in the room was offended. However since Anil is the boss everybody smiled like it was a cute romantic joke. Anil stood up with his phone. And why do I have a Honda City to pick me up Tell them I am eligible for BMW if they dont have Mercedes yes of course I am. He said and hung up the phone. He let out a huge sigh and rubbed his face. It is a tough life when you have to fight for basic rights every day. OK focus focus he said to himself and everyone in the room straightened their backs. Sir as I was saying Bala started again. Anil had a flight back in four hours. I guess Bala hoped if he kept presenting time would run out for Anil to ask tough questions. Bala you have said a lot Anil said. All I care about is why have you lost seven big customers in a month. In every other market we have grown. All of us studied the floor. Two crore How can retail customers lose two crore They come to save their money in the bank not lose it Anil said. Such truisms had led him to become the star in the jargonfilled bank. So whose big idea was it to sell these ladies net stocks Anil asked. Sir Bala said and looked at me. Everyone turned to me. I had become guilty by collective gaze. You are Anil asked. Krish sir I said. You are from Chennai Anil said puzzled at my accent that didnt match the rest of the table. No Im from Delhi. Punjabi I nodded. DX www.desibbrg.com Anil didnt answer. He just laughed. The sadistic laugh of seeing a fish out of water gasp for life. What happened HR screwed up Anil said. His phone rang again. The secretary confirmed business class and a BMW pickup at the airport. Anil asked her to make sure it is a series at least. Remember the Tata Tea deal we did with BankAm I came back with that idiot MD from BankAm and the car company sends me a Toyota and a series for him. Can you imagine what I went through Anil emphasized again. The secretary confirmed she wouldnt make him slum it in a car that cost less than an apartment. Calmness spread in the room as Anils mood improved. Where was i Anil said and looked at me. He laughed again. Which college are you from IIMA I said. Salute sir Anil said and mocksaluted me. I didnt brag about my college you asshole I wanted to say. He got the name out of me. I went to IIMC. I was on the waitlist for IIMA but they never called me. I guess I am not as smart as you Anil said. I had no clue how to answer that question. Another trainee in the room was from IIMC and he introduced himself. They hifived before Anil turned to me again. But who cares I became the country manager and many of your IIMA seniors didnt Anil said and winked at me. Obviously you still care you obnoxious insecure prick I said to myself even as I smiled. What would life be without mental dialogue. So you had the idea of selling Internet stocks to housewives Anil asked after he touched down from his gloatflight. And Bala you didnt stop him. Sir I always try to encourage young talent. Plus IIMA I thought hed know Bala said picking on Anils resentment against my bluest of the blueblooded institute. IIMA yeah right Anil said. You have cost the bank more business than you can ever make back in five years. DX www.desibbrg.com I wondered if I should cancel my deal with Bala. Even the personalized coffee didnt seem worth it. What about monitoring Bala you didnt monitor when the losses started I was getting more business sir Bala said. We had a lunchbreak. I didnt join the group. One I had to prepare for IIT trigonometry for the class tomorrow with brotherinlaw. Two I didnt need any more slamming. And three the food was South Indian special which I had begun to hate by now and I was sure Anil would too. Postlunch Anil wrapped up the meeting. I want good customer numbers. Either bring those customers back or win new ones I dont care. And please have better food next time. We will sir we are working super hard Bala said. The other trainees nodded. Apart from the IIMC guy they hadnt spoken a word during the meeting. I can tell you this Internet debacle will lead to layoffs across the bank. And if we see Chennai at the bottom literally and figuratively there will be layoffs. Anil said and horror showed on all faces at his last words. And you HR error Anil said and tapped my shoulder. You need to buck up big time. The BMW came to the branch to take Anil and our anxieties away. Bala came to my desk after we had come back to our seats. Thanks buddy. I owe you he said. Big time buddy big time I said. DX www.desibbrg.com I figured it must be a special occasion when I heard excessive frying sounds from Ananyas kitchen. I had completed two months of tuitions and Manju had become smarter than the kids in the Complan and Bournvita ads. I could bet one month of my aftertax PF and HRA alary that Manju would crack IIT medical or any draconian entrance exam known to man. Most of it was his own work and my waking up at five had little to do with it. Whats going on I said and sneezed twice. The pungent smell of burnt chillies flared my nostrils. Special cooking for special guests Manju said while continuing to solve his physics numerical. Who Harish from the bay area Manju said. Harish who Another fryer went on the stove. This time smells of mustard curry leaves and onions reached us. If this was one of those prizewinning Indian novels Id spend two pages on how wonderful those smells were. However the only reaction I had was a coughing fit and teary eyes. You are rhumba sensitive Manju said and looked up at me in disgust. He stood up and went to the door. Switch on the exhaust fan amma he screamed and shut the door. Ananyas mother continued to tackle the contents of the fryer. OK you go for bath. They will come anytime Ananyas mother said and went to max volume Ananya Are you ready Who is Harish I asked again as Manju refused to look up from his problem. The nakshatram matched no so they are here. Ok so g is . metres per second squared and the root of Manju drifted off to the world he knew best leaving me alone to deal with my world where a boy was coming to meet my girlfriend to make her his wife. I yanked Manjus notebook from him. DX www.desibbrg.com Aiyo what Manju looked at me shocked. Whats the deal with Harish. Tell me now or Ill tell your mother you watch porn I said. Manju looked stunned. I dont watch porn he said in a scared voice. Dont lie to me I said. Every boy watches porn. Only once I s saw a blue film at my friends house by mistake he stuttered. How can you watch it by mistake It belonged to my friends dad. Please dont tell amma. His face even his spectacles looked terrified. I closed the books. Tell me all about Harish. How did this happen Manju told me about Harish the poster boy of the perfect Tamilian groom. Radha aunty had pitched Harish for the last two years. He fit every criteria applied by Indian parents to make him a worthwhile match for Ananya. He was Tamilian a Brahmin and an Iyer and those are three separate things and noncompliance in any can get you disqualified. He had studied in IIT Chennai and had scored a GPA of . yes it was advertised to the Swamis He went on to do an MS with full scholarship and now worked in Cisco Systems an upcoming Silicon Valley company. He never drank or ate meat or smoked or had fun by extension and had a good knowledge of Carnatic music and Bharatnatyam. He had a full halfinchthick moustache his own house in the San Francisco suburbs a white Honda Accord and stock options that apart from the last three months had doubled every twelve minutes. He even had a telescope he used to see galaxies on the weekend I told you he had no fun. Manju was more excited at the prospect of seeing the telescope and thought it reason enough for his sister to marry that guy. He said you can actually see the colours on the rings of Saturn Manju said excited. You spoke to him He called. Couple of times Manju said. Ananya spoke to him DX www.desibbrg.com No. he used to call when she wasnt at home. Anyway until the nakshatram matches the boy and the girl are not allowed to talk. Nakshatram what I asked. The list of Tamilian hoops one needs to jump before getting married seemed infinite. Horoscope. It is a must. If they dont match boy and girls side dont talk. But they have matched for akka and him. I thought about my own family. The only nakshatram we think about is the division of petrol pumps when we have to see the girl. You are a science whiz kid who wants to see Saturn rings. And you accept that people whose horoscopes dont match shouldnt talk I said. Thats how it is in our culture Manju said his hands itching to get to his workbook. I gave him back his notes. And he is coming now I said. Yes for breakfast. And please dont snatch my notebook again. I am sorry I said and stood up. I wanted to have a showdown with Ananya about this. Surely shed have known a bit more about his visit. But for now I wanted to get out. Bye Manju I said as I turned to leave. Krish bhaiya can I ask you one thing he said. What I said. Can something bad happen if you watch blue films I stared at him. I wont I promise I just wanted to know he said. If you just watch them Just watching and he said and hesitated and if you do something else afterwards. Why dont you ask your appa Aiyo what are you saying DX www.desibbrg.com You could become blind I said with a serious face. Really He said how is that possible Be careful I winked at him and left. Welcome welcome greetings had started at the entrance even before I could leave the house. A crowd had gathered at the main door Ananyas dad and mom Shobha athai three other Kanjeevaramclad aunties and two random uncles in safari suits became the welcome party. They received Harish like an astronaut who had returned from the first Indian lunar mission. The only time grownups get excited about young people is when young people are getting married and the old people control the proceedings. I had come to Ananyas house several times and I had received a welcome no better than the guy who came to collect the cable bill. But Harish had it all. Aunties looked at him like he was a cuddly twoyearold only he was fifty times the size and had a moustache that could scare any cuddly twoyearold. He wore sunglasses quite unnecessary at seven in the morning apart from showing off his sense of misplaced style. He had come with his parents a snug Tamilian family who walked into the room with their overachiever in shades. Fortunately he removed them when he sat on the sofa. Ananyas father noticed me with a confused expression. Uncle I was leaving I said. Sorry. I came for Manjus tuitions. Had breakfast he asked. No I said. Then sit he said. The firmness in his voice made me obey instantly. I wanted to wriggle out of it but a part of me wanted to see the drama unfold. Uncles attention shifted to the new guests. Maybe he had made me stay intentionally. I perched in a corner chair like a domestic servant who is sometimes allowed to watch TV. The taxi driver came in to ask for his bill and Harishs dad stepped outside to settle it. They couldnt agree on the price and their argument began to heat up. DX www.desibbrg.com Harishs dad bargained for the last five rupees even as Harishs mother casually mentioned another of their sons achievement. MIT calling him requesting him to do Ph.D. at their college. All the ladies in the room had a mini orgasm. Marble flooring is to a Punjabi what a foreign degree is to a Tamilian. But his Cisco boss said nothing doing. You cannot leave me. Harishs mother said. Harish kept a constant smile during the conversation. Manju came into the room and called me. What I asked dreading another physics problem. I went into his room. Ananya sat on his bed wearing a stunning peacock blue sari the same colour she wore the day I had proposed to her. Go your groom is waiting I said. Manju leave the room she said. Manju had already sat down to study again. Aiyo where should I go Go and meet the guests. Or help Amma in the kitchen Ananya said in a nononsense way. Manju went to the living room with the physics guide. I turned away from Ananya. Im sorry she said. Who the fuck invented the word sorry How can there be just one word to answer for anything one does. Tomorrow you could marry Mr Sunglasses outside and then say sorry. What am I supposed to say Dont overreact. I am doing it to fob off Shobha aunty. I still have the final say. Ill say no. Why didnt you tell me Because this is not important. You saw the petrol pump girl didnt you But I told you later. And it wasnt a formal thing. My mother went to visit Pammi aunty. DX www.desibbrg.com And neither is this formal. My parents said Harish is only coming for a casual visit. Oh so people match horoscopes casually It is the first step. And Shobha aunty did it. Krish listen Ananya a Tamilaccented scream filled the room. I love you she said and I have to go now. She brushed past me to the door. Why are you wearing this stunning sari I placed my hand on the bolt to stop her. Because my mother chose it for me. Now can I go or do you want appa to come here Lets elope I said. Lets not give up she stood up on her toes to kiss me. The taste of strawberry lipgloss lingered on m lips. I came outside after five minutes. The hubbub over Harish had settled down a little. The men opened their newspapers. The women gave each other formal smiles like ballet dancers. The groom took out his latest Motorola Startac mobile phone checking messages. Ananyas mother served her standard fossilised snake snacks. No one spoke to each other. In a Punjabi home if a similar silence occurred you could assume that something terrible has happened like someone has died or there is a property dispute or someone forgot to put butter in the black daal. But this is Ananyas home protocol. You meet in an excited manner you serve bland snacks and you open the newspaper or exchange dead looks. My reentry made everyone notice me. Ananyas mother seemed surprised. Ananya sat next to her and faced Harishs parents. I occupied my corner chair. Manjus tutor Ananyas mother said. Everyone looked at me the tutor who came to teach in a corporate suit. He is Ananya akkas classmate Manju said restoring some status to me. You also went to IIMA I have many colleagues who are your seniors Harish said. Really Thats nice I said. I wanted to shove the spiral snacks up his moustachecovered nose but I kept a diplomatic smile. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananyas father spoke to Harishs father in Tamil. Something something Citibank Chennai posted something. Something something Punjabi fellow. Everyone nodded and felt relieved after my credentials of being a Punjabi made me a safe outsider. Talk Ananya Ananyas mother whispered to her. How long are you here for Ananya asked as her bangles jingled. She really didnt have to wear the bangles. Two weeks. Then I have to go for our annual conference to Bali he said. Bali one of Ananyas aunts said. Bali is an island in Indonesia an archipelago. It is eight hours flying time from here via Singapore Harishs mother said. Everyone nodded as they absorbed the little nugget of knowledge before breakfast. Ananyas family loved knowledge irrespective of whether they ever used it. We moved to the dining table or rather the dining floor. Ananyas mother had already kept the banana leaves. I found them a little greener than usual perhaps my jealousy reflected in them. Aunties loaded up Harishs leaf. This is too much Harish said pointing to the six idlis on his leaf. Does anyone want one He picked up an idli and placed it in Ananyas leaf. Wow all the aunties screamed in unison. See how much care he is taking of her already. You are so lucky Ananya an aunt said as I almost tore a piece of banana leaf and ate it. I saw the bowl of sambhar in the middle. I wondered if I should pick it up and upturn it on Harishs head. She can take her own idlis idiot why dont you go drown in Bali I thought. Harish thought it really funny to shift everything he was served to Ananya. He transferred parts of upma pongal chutney and banana chips from his leaf to hers. Really Harish did anybody teach you not to stretch a bad joke too far And all you aunts can you please stop sniggering so as to no encourage this moron DX www.desibbrg.com We must decide the date keeping in mind the US holiday calendar Shobha aunty said and I felt she was moving way way too fast. Easy aunty easy Ananya said. Thanks Ananya madam that is so nice of you to finally impart some sense to these people. You OK Manju offered an idli to me. I had spent two months with him. He could sense the turmoil in me. Im good I said. The breakfast continued. And then Ananyas mother did something that paled all the idlipassing and datesetting comments. She began to cry. Amma Ananya said as she stood up and came to her mother. Amma shook her head. Manju looked at her but didnt stop eating. The uncles pretended nothing had happened. What Radha Suruchi aunty said as she put a hand on Ammas shoulder. Nothing I am so happy. I am crying for that she said in such an emotional voice even I got a lump in my throat. All the other aunts had moist eyes. Harishs mother hugged Ananyas mother. I looked at Ananya. She rolled her eyes. How quickly our children grow up one aunt said ignoring the small fact that with the children shed grown into an old woman too. Im going to get you all I will I swore to myself as I went to wash my hands. DX www.desibbrg.com Why dont you tell them This gradual strategy is obviously not working I said as I opened the menu. We had come to Amethyst a charming teahouse set in an old colonial bungalow. It is one of the few redeeming aspects of the city. Set in a oneacre plot the bungalow is on two levels. Outside the bungalow there are grand verandahs with cane furniture and potted plants with large leaves. Waiters bring eclectic drinks like jamun iced tea and mint and ginger coolers along with expensive dishes with feta cheese in them. It is a favourite haunt of stylish Chennai ladies and couples so madly in love they feel a hundred bucks for jamun mixed with soda was OK. Ill have the jamun iced and chicken sandwich and some scones and cream please. Ananya said. And some water please I said to the waiter. Still or sparkling sir the waiter said. Whatever you had a bath with this morning Krish said. Sir the waiter said taken aback tap water sir. Same get me that I said. I have told them of course. They dont agree Ananya said as we reverted to our topic. Is Mr Harish history Finally though it will take two years to make Shobha athai OK again. She is like tell me one thing wrong with Harish. He cant get a woman on his own I said. Shut up Krish Ananya laughed. You know how I finally closed it Did you tell him about me Sort of. Sort of I said my voice loud. I am not Mr Sort Of. I am The Guy. DX www.desibbrg.com Yeah but I cant tell him exactly. How would he feel My boyfriend sat with me when he came to see me. Imagine how I felt. Anyway what did you tell him He asked me rather hinted about my virginity. He did not I will kill that bastard I said my face red. Ananya laughed. Jealousy is rather enjoyable emotion to watch she observed. Funny. He just said wait let me remember. Yes he said are you still pure or something she giggled. What a loser. What is he looking for ghee I asked. Ananya laughed uncontrollably. She held her stomach as she spoke. Wait youll die if I told you my response. And that is I told him Harish if there is an entrance exam for virginity you can be sure I wont top it Ananya said. You did not And then And then the Cisco guy hung up the phone. No more Harish finite. Radha aunty said now Harish also doesnt like me. Yipee The waiter brought us our drinks. The contents looked like water after youve dipped several paintbrushes in it. The jamun tea tasted different though different doesnt translate into nice. Amethyst is about ambience not nourishment. Ananya we need to bring this to closure. Im not getting traction with your parents. Manju maybe but others barely acknowledge me. You will. In fact thats why I called you here today. You have a chance to score with dad. I cant. I told you he folded his hands at me. He is dying doing his presentation. No one in Bank of Baroda has ever made a business plan. He doesnt know computers. It is crazy. DX www.desibbrg.com I offered help. He said no. He wont say no now. I could help him but I am travelling most of the time. And if you help him it may work. May the key word is may. Can be replaced just as easily with may not I said. Try Ananya said and placed her hands on mine. It was probably the only restaurant in Chennai she would try such a stunt. Here it looked sort of OK. First your brother then your father. If nothing else Ill be your family tutor I said as I sipped the last few drops of my tea. And my lover Ananya winked. Thanks. And what about your mother How can I make her cry in happiness like the purityseeking Harish Ananya threw up her hands. Dont ask me about mom she said. One she gives me a guilt trip about Harish everyday. And two Chennai has put her in her place about her Carnatic music abilities. She has stopped singing altogether. And that makes her even more miserable which creates her own selfguilt trip which is then transferred to me and the cycle continues. Even I cant help her with this. Work on dad for now. I nodded as Ananya paused to catch her breath. Thanks for bearing this she said and fed me a scone dipped in cream. I licked cream off her fingers. Little things like these kept me going. Easy this is a public place she said. She pulled her hand back as the waiter arrived with the bill. I paid and left him a tip bigger than my daily lunch budget. Hey you want to go dancing she asked. Dancing You have an eight oclock curfew. How can we go dancing Because in Chennai we go dancing in the afternoon. Lets go Sheraton has a nice DJ. At three in the afternoon Yes everybody goes. They banned nightclubs so we have afternoon clubs. DX www.desibbrg.com We took an auto to the Sheraton. I am not kidding a hundred youngsters in party clothes waited outside in the sunny courtyard. The disco opened in ten minutes. Everyone went inside and the lights were switched off. The bar started business. The DJ put on the latest Rajni Tamil track. The crowd went crazy as everyone apart from me registered the song. Ananya moved her body to the music. She danced extremely well as did most others trained in Bharatnatyam while growing up. Naan onnai kadalikaren she said I love you in Tamil. I took her in my arms. I looked around at the youngsters doing what they loved despite everyone from their parents to the government banning them from doing so. Yes if there can be afternoon discos Punjabis can marry Tamilians. Rules after all are only made so you can work around them. Uncle Ananya told me you are having trouble with your business plan. Uncle braked his car in shock. We never spoke in the Fiat. We had a ritual. I read my reports he cursed the traffic and the city roads. In twenty minutes we reached the traffic signal near the Citibank where he dropped me. I thanked him he nodded all without eye contact. Today one week after my Amethyst date I had made my move. Ananya had gone to Thanjavur on work for five days and her mother joined her on the trip to see the temples. Ananya had told me it would be the perfect time to offer help. Her father wouldnt suspect I wanted to come home for Ananya. Plus more important he could actually take help from me I looked around at the youngsters doing what they loved despite everyone from their parents to the government banning them from doing so. Yes if there can be afternoon discos Punjabis can marry Tamilians. Rules after all are only made so you can work around them. DX www.desibbrg.com Uncle Ananya told me you are having trouble with your business plan. Uncle braked his car in shock. We never spoke in the Fiat. We had a ritual. I read my reports he cursed the traffic and the city roads. In twenty minutes we reached the traffic signal near the Citibank where he dropped me. I thanked him he nodded all without eye contact.

Ananya had told me it would be the perfect time to offer help. Her father wouldnt suspect I wanted to come home for Ananya. Plus more important he could actually take help from me and keep face as his wife and daughter wont be there to witness. Why is she telling you all this His hands clenched on the steering wheel. Actually I had helped my boss make a business plan I lied. Really His expression softened and he looked at me. MNC banks make presentations all the time I said. Uncle released the brake as the car moved again. Do you want me to sit down with you I offered as we reached closer to the Citibank signal. You take tuitions for Manju already. Why are you helping us so much I thought hard for an answer. I dont have anyone in Chennai. No old friends no family I said. His eyebrows went up at the last word. Of course you are also not family I said and his face relaxed again. But it is nice to go to a home. I had reached my signal. I opened the door slowly to allow him time to respond. If you have time come in the evening. I will show you what I have done. Oh OK I will come tonight I said as uncle drove off. The Fiat left behind a fresh waft of carbon monoxide. DX www.desibbrg.com I think it is a great idea Bala said. We sat in our priority banking group team meeting. Mumbai had proposed a raise spirits dinner event for our private clients across India. Despite the economic slowdown they had approved they had approved a budget for all major centres. Chennai needed it most given the adventure banking we had subjected our clients to. So we need to brainstorm on which event will work best for Chennai customers Bala said. An art exhibition one executive said. Again we are selling something another executive said. The focus should be on fun. A fashion show said the earlier executive. Too bold for our market came the counter response. The discussion continued for ten minutes. All ideas form movienight to inventing a Kollywood celebrity to calling a chef to prepare an exotic cuisine were discussed. However for some reason none of the ideas clicked. I felt quite useless having nothing to say. But I didnt know what would work for Chennai customers apart from giving them their money back. Krish what do you think Bala asked breaking my daydream of walking handinhand with Ananya in a peacock blue sari. Huh I said and realised everyone had turned to me. Would you like to contribute Bala said. Even though he had cut me slack on occasion the repressed boss in him came out. Music how about music Say a musical night I suggested. Excited murmurs ran across the room. Finally we had an idea without any strong negative objection. However within music there were a dozen ideas. Kutcheri lets do a kutcheri said one. Whats that I said turning to Saraswati. DX www.desibbrg.com Saraswati was a conservative Tamilian agent who spoke only once a year and never waxed her arms. I admit the latter point is irrelevant but it is hard not to notice these things. Kutcheri is a Carnatic music concert Saraswati made her point and drifted back to being part of the wall. Hey I thought we wanted the evening to be fun I said. Carnatic music can be fun said Ravi another supervisor. Yes as much fun as wailing babies in a crowded train I wanted to say but didnt. Political correctness is a necessity in Chennai especially when everyone hates you for being an outsider anyway. I turned to Bala. We want to raise spirits. Isnt Carnatic music too serious Why not have an evening of popular music. Good popular music. A.R. Rahman can we get A.R. Rahman said one person. Or Ilaiyaraja said another. Bala shook his head and waved his arms to say no. We cant do such big names. The budget is not that high. And these people attract the press. Last thing you want is some customer telling the press about their losses and us wasting money on such concerts. Mumbai will kill me. After two hours of further deliberation that took us to lunch break we made a few decisions about the event. The concert would be held in Fishermans Cove an upmarket resort on the city outskirts. Wed have three to five singers of reasonable fame provided we kept to the budget of two lakh. All set then Bala said as we ended the meeting at six in the evening. I realised I had to leave. After all I had a big date with the big daddy tonight. DX www.desibbrg.com So this is almost done I clicked through the slides. Uncle had given me a CD of his work. I had uploaded it on my laptop. The unformatted slides had paragraphs of text no bullet points and font sizes ranging from eight to seventytwo. Yes I spent three weeks on it he said. We sat at a worktable in the living room. Manju studied inside. No one else was at home. Ananyas father and I hunched close together to see the laptop screen. These have no figures no charts no specific points even I said trying to be less critical but truthful as well. Figures are here uncle said as he opened his briefcase. I still have to learn that feature in PowerPoint. He took out three thick files with dirty brown covers and two hundred sheets each inside. Whats this Our last year business data he said. You cant put it all I said. When is this due That rascal Verma wants it in a week uncle said. The rate at which Ananyas dad was going he couldnt deliver it in a year. One week This is only past performance data. Dont you have to make a plan for next year I was going to do that soon. He swallowed hard. I kept my left elbow on the table and my palm on my forehead. I flipped through the slides in reverse to reach the front. What he said. Anything wrong in what Ive done I turned to him and gave a slight smile. No a few finishing touches left I said. So how do we do it DX www.desibbrg.com Lets start by you telling me what exactly you do at the bank. And then take me through these files. I shut the laptop. For the next three hours I understood what a deputy district manager does at a public sector bank. Actually there is a lot of work contrary to my belief that government bank staff did nothing. However a lot of the work is about reporting approvals and maintaining certain records. It is more beauraucracy and less business. I yawned as he finished explaining how the staffrecruiting process works in his Egmore district. I looked at the wall clock. It was ninethirty. Sorry I didnt even ask you for dinner Mr Swaminathan said. Its OK keep going. Ill wash my face I said and pulled back my chair. I came back from the bathroom and uncle had brought two steel plates and a bowl of lemon rice. He put the bowl in the microwave to heat the food. Sorry I cant give you proper dinner tonight. I told the maid to make something simple he said. Its fine I said as I took the plates off him. I went to the kitchen. I picked up the curd and water. I saw the spoons but decided not to take them. Manju I asked as I returned to the table. He ate already. He wakes up at four so he has to sleep now uncle said. We ate in silence. For the first time in their house I felt welcome. Sure theyd give me breakfast and a lift to work three days a week. However today was different. Uncle refilled my plate when I finished and poured water for me. We continued to work after dinner until he couldnt keep his eyes open. Its eleventhirty Id better go I said. I shut down my laptop and stacked all the papers together. Yes uncle said as he looked at his watch. I didnt realise this would be so much work. I came to the door and outlined the agenda. Heres the plan I said. Tomorrow we make a structure so we at least have a title for all fifty slides that need to be there. The next day we will put the text. Day after we will start on the figures and charts. We came out of the house. DX www.desibbrg.com Its late. I will drop you uncle said. No there are autos on the main road. Good night uncle tell Manju I will see him day after. Thank you Krish uncle said as he waved me goodbye. Anytime I said. DX www.desibbrg.com I spent the next three evenings in the company of Mr Swaminathan. The Bank of Baroda Egmore district business plan had become the focus of my life. I brought some of uncles work to my own office and worked on it in the afternoon. What are you working on Bala said as we met near the common office printer where I had come to collect a printout of uncles presentation. Personal research I said as I clenched he sheets in my hand and ran back to my desk. It is uncanny but I could tell Ananyas call from the phone ring. Hi hottie. How is it going Did you know Bank of Baroda had no ATMs four years ago but now there are over a dozen ATMs in Egmore alone I said as I opened the twelfth slide of the presentation. What she said. And in two years there will be thirty I said. What are you talking about I am working on your dads presentation in my office I said and swiveled my chair to turn away from the monitor. Thats why you are such a sweetie she said. I am stealing a talented MBAs time paid for by Citibank. I could go to jail for this I said. How exciting My lover goes to jail for me she chuckled. Manju told me you are there every evening until late. And today you took Manjus morning tuitions too. Take care of yourself. Im fine. I rest in the office. And the presentation should be done tonight. Cool. Hows the bonding with appa DX www.desibbrg.com Well it is pretty businesslike. But lets just say I saw him smile. I bit a whole chilli at dinner and ran to the kitchen. When I returned he smiled for three whole seconds and I created it. With my dada thats huge Ananya said. He didnt smile in any of his wedding pictures. Well he had to marry your mom I said. Shut up Ananya said. The peon came to me to say Bala had tried my extension and couldnt reach. I told Ananya to hold Well he had to marry your mom I said. Shut up Ananya said. The peon came to me to say Bala had tried my extension and couldnt reach. I told Ananya to hold. Tell him I am with a prospective new client. Inviting them to the concert I said. The peon nodded and left. Concert Ananya said. It is a private client event. At Fishermans Cove I said. Fishermans Cove is nice. Can I come she said. Only if you have ten lakh to spare I said. Sure my husband will send the cash Ananya said. Yeah right after I execute my bank robbery. OK now should I humour you or make sure your father doesnt get laughed at in five days I said. Daddy first she said. I am back in three days. How is Thanjavur Temples Tamilians and a temperamental mother. Care she said. Maybe next time. Whats causing the temperamentalness Me me and only me Ananya said and laughed as is always the case. Really Whats your crime now DX www.desibbrg.com I dont have time for her. Which is true as Im all over the district in meetings the entire day. Of course she also feels saying no to Harish is like declining the Nobel Prize. And so thats the dinner appetizer. Main course is a lecture on how Ive abused my privilege of being allowed to study further. Dessert is usually tears. I have to go to Pondicherry next week. No way I am taking her. You have to go Just a day trip. Hey isnt Fishermans Cove on the way to Pondicherry I asked. Yes why Good I should take the initiative and check out the venue. Ill come with you that day I said. Anything to get out of office. Oh cool she said. The peon came again. Yes I turned to the peon after asking Ananya to hold. Sir is asking which client peon said. I looked around. Outside the office window there were several hoardings. I saw one for fireworks. Standard Fireworks Sivakasi. OK I said. The peon nodded. Bye sweetie am I disturbing you Yeah but what is life without being disturbed by the right people I said. Thank you. Love you Ananya said. I love you too I said and hung up the phone. The peon stood in front of me his eyes big after the last line. Why are you still here I said. Sorry sir the peon said and left. DX www.desibbrg.com I left my office early to finish the presentation at uncles house. We had come to the end with only final formatting left. I passed a CD store in Mylapore. Some music would be nice while I completed the presentation I thought I went in. What you want sir the shopkeeper said. I scanned the shelves filled with Tamil CDs in psychedelic covers resembling crime novels. What nonTamil CDs do you have I asked. He shook his head in disappointment. NonTamil you go to Nungambakkam sir. But the shop attendant looked through his collection to find something. OK here he said as he took out three CDs. The first CD was nonstop Hindi remixed hits. It had girls with cleavage on the cover. I had to reject it. The second was a romantic lovesongs collection that had a heartshaped cover. The third CD was nursery rhymes in English. Give me the love songs I said. The shopkeeper made the bill as I scanned a section on Carnatic music. Any good Carnatic music CDs I said. Good meaning what sir he said as he wrapped my redcoloured CD. I looked at the Carnatic covers. Most of them had middleaged Tamilian men and women on them. Do you have any greatest hits collection in Carnatic I said. The shopkeeper looked puzzled. I threw up my hands in despair. I have no clue. I want to get started I said. North Indian he said. I nodded. Then why you want to learn Carnatic music I didnt answer. The shopkeeper gave me two CDs. One had a woman holding a tambura on the cover. The other had the picture of an old man. The entire text was in Tamil. I flipped it around. T.R. Subramanium nice said an elderly lady who had just walked into the shop and noticed my CDs. DX www.desibbrg.com Yeah my alltime favourite I said as I kept the CDs in my bag and walked out of the shop. I reached Ananyas place at .. Uncle already sat at the table. He wore reading glasses and made corrections on a printout of the presentation. He had kept hot vadas on the table with red green and white coloured chutneys. Take one. It is a famous shop near my office. I brought them for you uncle said. I looked at him as I picked up a vada. We made eye contact for the first time ever since I had known him. I noticed that if you ignored the wrinkly face and the reading glasses he had the same eyes as Ananya. So today no matter how late it gets we finish this I said as I opened the file. Uncle nodded. He pulled his chair close to mine to see the screen. OK so lets go through each slide. I will format as we go along I said. I went through the first five slides in an hour. Uncle do you mind if I put some music on This formatting is quite tedious I said. I opened the CD player in my laptop. Play it on the stereo uncle said and pointed to the hifi system kept in the living room display cabinet. I too out the CDs from my office bag. Uncle walked up with me to connect the system. He fiddled with the wires as I noticed a onelitre unopened bottle of Chivas Regal whisky kept next to the stereo system. I took my chances and asked him. You like whisky No just a little peg sometimes when I have a cold. Harish gave me this big bottle. It will last me years he said. I kept quiet. You know Harish The boy who came to see Ananya. DX www.desibbrg.com I nodded. Really good boy he said. Uncle switched the stereo on. I gave him the heart shaped CD in my bag. Uncle turned it around in his hands a few times. Thats all the Mylapore shop had I said in a sheepish voice. What are the others I showed him the other two CDs. T.R. Subramanium and M. S. Sheela Who did you get this for For myself. You understand Carnatic music No but I want to learn. Ive heard it is the purest form of music I said. Uncle shook his head. I wondered if my reason had not come across as real. He put the CDs back in my bag. Sometimes I wish I had never encouraged Radha in Carnatic music. It has only given her pain. I nodded not sure of how I should respond. Uncle was talking personal for the first time. It is amazing how much closeness two men with a laptop in a closed room can achieve in five days. We sat back at the table as I worked on the sixth slide. Mandy Moores romantic track filled the room. I wanna be with you If only for the night The lyrics were a little odd for a work date between a fiftyyearold Tamilian and a twentyfouryearold Punjabi boy but better than the silence. I enjoyed putting the textboxes tables charts and lists in their right place and making each slide look slick. Uncle read each point and checked the figures. The song continued. To be one who is in your arms Who holds you tight DX www.desibbrg.com The CD played itself over three times before I reached the halfway mark. We paused for dinner at ten. Uncle went to the kitchen and came back with tomato rice in two plates. You must be bored of South Indian food he said. No I am used to it now. Feels like home food I said. Good he said. He went to the display cabinet. I had made it to the category of good though still not really good like Harish I thought. The presentation is under control now. You want a drink uncle said. Sure I said. Uncle took out two glasses from the crockery rack in the display cabinet. He told me to get a spoon and ice form the kitchen. He opened the bottle. Five spoons for me is enough he said as he made his drink. How about you We dont use spoon to measure alcohol I said. I was a little agitated. One week of working my ass off and still Harish was the really good boy. Fuck you Harish I am going to have your Chivas Regal. I poured the golden coloured liquid four fingers thick. What are you doing he exclaimed. Making myself a real drink. Cheers I said and lifted my glass. Actually Radha stops me from having more uncle said and took the bottle from me. He tilted it and made his drink level with mine. Cheers he said and thank you. You IITians are very smart. What a presentation you have made. You are welcome I said. We finished our dinner and first drink by tenthirty. I brought the whisky bottle next to the laptop. I poured a second drink for myself and offered it to uncle. He didnt decline. The song changed to Last Christmas. DX www.desibbrg.com Uncle went to the stereo and increased the volume. I gave you my heart uncle sang in sync with the song and snapped his finger. He came back and sat down. I had witnessed an amazing sight. A Tamil Brahmin had set himself free probably for the first time. If I didnt have the presentation to make Id have loved to observe him more. All I remember is that in the next two hours we reached the last slide and the onethird mark on the whisky bottle. And thank you I said as I read the last slide. Here we go it is done. I saved the file. Save it twice uncle said. I saved it again and checked the time. It was a.m. In three hours Manju would wake up. All ready to present it I asked. Present Me No no Verma will present this. My job was to complete this and its done. Uncle I said my voice firmed by the whisky you have to present. Whats the point of slaving over this for weeks if you dont get to present. I have never operated that projector uncle said. Theres nothing to it. You IT will set it up. And you press the forward button to move to the next slide. I dont know. He turned quiet. I closed my laptop and shook my head. This is unbelievable. The presentation is in such good shape. Your country manager will be there. And all you want to do is sit in a corner. Verma will take all the credit. Really he said. Thats what all bosses do without exception I said. Bloody North Indian fellow uncle said. I stood up to leave. Sleepy he asked. DX www.desibbrg.com Not as much as you. You sleep at ten right I said. This has woken me up uncle said pointing me to his drink. Want another one Uncle I have to find an auto. Its late. Why dont you just stay here he said. Excuse me I said. Yes. Ill give you a set of nightclothes. Mine should fit you he said. I had pastlife trauma of wearing my girlfriends fathers clothes. This cant be a good idea I thought. Before I could respond uncle had poured us another round of drinks. Change the music if you want he said. I rifled through Ananyas tapes in the drawer. I found a Pink Floyd album and couldnt resist. The alcohol demanded Floyd. The long trippy opening note of Shine On You Crazy Diamond played in the room. Uncle tapped a foot gently to the slow beats. I wondered if he would be able to handle so much alcohol. I longed to smoke. No dont think about smoking my mind advised. Dont think about being with Ananya. Think about the worstcase emergency plan. What if uncle threw up or fainted How do you call an ambulance in Chennai How would you explain it to Ananyas mother However uncle seemed to be having a good time. He sat on the sofa and put his legs on the table. One thing Verma told me I will never forget he said. I nodded. Verma said Swaminathan do you know why they make you deputy GM and sent me to become GM Why I said too drunk to show restraint. He said it was because South Indians are top class number two officers but horrible in number one positions. Uncle shook his head as he took a big sip. Even in his drunkenness I could see his pain. I didnt know what to say. Do you agree he asked. DX www.desibbrg.com Oh I dont know. My boss is South Indian I said. Yes but you have just started. Maybe he is right. We hate the limelight. I know I should present this but I dont want to. Why Because knowledge is not for showing off. If I do good work people should notice me. I cannot go sell myself like that shameless Verma. I nodded more to tell him I listened than in agreement. There is no better source of wisdom than two drunk men. Right Depends. I said. On what Did you feel bad when they didnt make you GM I said. Uncle looked at me for a few seconds. He leaned forward from the sofa to come near me. Let me tell you one thing. What is your name he said. Obviously I was not anywhere close to getting close to him. Krish I said. Of course sorry this whisky Anyway Krish I had offers. Ten years back I had offers from multinational banks. But I stayed loyal to my bank. And I was patient to get my turn to be GM. Now I have five years to retire and they send this rascal North Indian. You did feel bad I said. I still feel horrible. I havent even told this to my wife. I am drinking too much he said. Its OK. The point is if you feel horrible then you need to do what it takes to get to be number one. And. I stopped myself. What Say it he said. And if you dont have marketing skills then better admit that than take a moral high ground about knowledge. Youve done good work let the world know. What the hell is cheap or shameless about that Uncle didnt respond. DX www.desibbrg.com Im sorry I said composing myself. No you are right. I am useless he said his voice quivering. I became worried hed cry. I didnt say that. We made this right I pointed to my laptop. You think I should present Will I be able to he asked. You will kick ass I said. What Sorry I said you need ice He shook his head. Youll be fine. Tell Verma you will present this. Dont give him a copy. Ill fight with him Yes if you call it that I said. And make sure from now on people know about the work you do. Look at Bala my boss. He copies the country manager on everything. Bala briefed the country manager about the food menu for this stupid local concert we are having next month. You definitely have to get noticed you dont have to work. Thats how corporates work everyone knows it. Uncle nodded and fell deep in thought. I checked the time a.m. I couldnt control a yawn. OK we should go to bed uncle said and stood up. Wait. He came back with a lungi and a vest. Here will this do You got to be kidding me I wanted to say but said Perfect. Uncle showed me the guestroom. I sat down on the bed with the nightclothes in my lap. What do you want to be MD at Citibank uncle asked me as he reached the door to leave my room. A writer I said. Excuse me he said and his tired body became alert again. MD country manager I dont care Its not me I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Will you leave the bank Not immediately. Ill save for a couple of years first. And after that What about your parents Are they OK with this Well see. You should sleep uncle. You have a presentation to make tomorrow I said. Uncle switched off t he main light and left. I went to the bathroom and struggled with my lungi. Finally I used a belt to tie it around my waist and lay down in bed. My back was resting after eighteen hours I let out a sigh of relief. Uncle knocked on my door. He came inside and switched on the light again. I sat up on the bed in one jerk. What Water uncle said as he left a bottle next to my bed. Drink up or you will have a headache in the office tomorrow. Thanks I said. You OK with that lungi You need help No I am fine I said and clutched my belt and modesty close to myself. Good night uncle said as he switched off the light again. Good night sir I said and cursed myself for the next ten minutes for calling him sir. DX www.desibbrg.com Three lakh Bala flipped during the concert steering committee meeting. Yes one of the great value additions from Bala is to make everything sound important. He created the CSC or the Concert Steering Committee. It sounded so important I could almost put it in my resume. But right now we had a problem. Everyone kept silent as the person in charge of the singers gave her report. You want three celebrity singers sir said Madhavi a fat agent with spectacles who looked like a cross between a school prefect and an ICU nurse. But how can they get paid so much Bala said. Somehow Bala felt only he deserved a job that paid far in excess of the work involved. They come with a band sir and backup singers Madhavi said. Everyone in the room nodded. Bala shook his head. Why do we need backup singers The main ones will crash or something Nobody laughed. Backup means chorus sir Madhavi said. Bala remained unimpressed. Chorus are those people who say aa aa aa in love songs sir said Renuka another agent. I know what chorus is Bala said as he banged his fist on the table. But this is too much. We can cut the food said one agent. He got more dirty looks than an eveteaser in a bus. He retracted his suggestion. Why dont we get some lesser known singers I asked. But this is a Citibank event. If we get Bgrade singers and tomorrow HSBC does an event with Agrade singers we are screwed Bala said. Sir the venue. One agent who had never spoken in a meeting in his entire career was shot down in midsentence. DX www.desibbrg.com Has to be fivestar Bala said. Who is the top singer of the three I said. Hariharan said one agent. No it is S.P. Balasubramanium said another. War broke out between the normally peaceful Tamilians. When it came to music they could kill. No match Hari is no match for SP Madhavi shouted emotionally. Suchitra You forgot Suchitra another agent said. Bala stood up. Like all corporate meetings worldwide even this one had ended without a conclusion. All I am saying is we cant afford to pay this much. The venue food and advertising are already costing four lakh Bala said. Advertising I asked. We are giving a halfpage ad in The Hindu Bala said. The agents closed their files to leave. Isnt it an invitationonly event I said. Exactly the ad will say so. Only our customers will have the invites. However the ad will ensure their friends and relatives feel jealous. Thats the Citi advantage I said. Exactly. Bala patted my back. So dads happy huh I quizzed Ananya inside the auto. You bet. Dad only talks about the presentation at dinner every day. And now hes in Delhi to make the same presentation in head office. Can you believe it Ananya said. Wow I said as we reached our destination. DX www.desibbrg.com We had come to Ratna Stores in T. Nagar to buy steel plates for my chummery. I needed four this place had four million of them. Seriously every wall roof corner shelf and rack over two floors was covered with shiny steel utensils. If direct sunlight fell in the store you could burn like an ant under a magnifying glass. I wondered how the store kept track of its inventory. How do you ever choose I said to Ananya as we neared the plates section. Ananya demonstrated the desired width with her hands to one of the attendants. Seriously thanks for helping dad. I think he likes you now she said. Not as much as he likes Harish. I drank his whisky though. What Ananya said. I told Ananya about our drinks session. You wore his what to bed she said shocked at the end of my story. Lungi I said as I paid at the cashiers counter. Whats so surprising It is quite comfortable. Ananya raised her eyebrows. I did it for you. I looked into her eyes. She moved forward and even though one could see our reflection in five hundred frying pans around us she kissed me. All the Tamilian housewives in the store turned to us in shock. Ananya a ladys voice came from behind us. Ananya turned around. Fuck Chitra aunty Ananya said lifting a large steel tray to hide her face. It was too late as the woman had started to come towards us. Chitra who I said. Chitra aunty lives in my lane. She sings Carnatic music with my mother Ananya said from behind the tray. I bought Carnatic music CDs too I said. What she said. DX www.desibbrg.com Never mind hello aunty I said as Chitra aunty came next to us. Krish Ananya said. Colleague. Really what kind of colleague Chitra aunty asked bossily. I have to go I said and lifted my plates. We need these before dinner. Ananya called me late at night after I had eaten in the new steel plates. All OK I said. Sort of Ananya said. She is going to tell my mother. They have this rivalry anyway. Guruji accepted her but not my mother. And then Nothing Ill tell my mother she is exaggerating. Am I mad enough to smooch someone in Ratna Stores she said. You are I laughed. Yes but only you know that. I dont want to ruin what Ive built with your dad I said. Its mom you have to worry about now. Manju and Dad are OK. How I dont know. I told her you are coming over for dinner tomorrow. Why The stated reason is to thank you for helping dad. We can tell her about our visit to Ratna Stores before Chitra aunty. Of course well skip a few bits. You shouldnt have kissed me there. Why did you do it Because I couldnt help it you are irresistible sometimes Ananya said. My heart stopped for a second at Ananyas response. Alright Mrs Swaminathan if your daughter cant resist me there is no way you can either. DX www.desibbrg.com Excellent presentation that is what the board told Dad in Delhi. Now theyve asked all zonal offices to make similar ones Ananya said in an excited voice. We sat on the floor for dinner. Ananyas mom kept quiet as she stirred a bowl of rasam. She offered it to me without a word. You OK mom Ananya said. Did you go to Ratna Stores with him Ananyas mother said pointing to me. Oh shit Chitra aunty had to tell you the next morning Ananya said her hand busy mixing the rice and daal. Akka dont use bad words at the dinner table Manju said. Manju you eat. I am talking to mom here Ananya said. Hes right. We dont talk like that in this house. We dont do the things you do either Ananyas mother said as she vented some of the anger on the rice in her leaf. She mashed and smashed it with all the vegetables extra hard. What have I done mom Krish wanted steel plates. How would he know where to go I took him to Ratna Stores. And you do cheap things in the store Ananyas mother said. What cheap things mom Manju said. Manju can you leave the room Go read you physics book Ananya bade. But Ive already revised physics today Manju said. Then study maths or chemistry for Gods sake. Go. Ananyas stern glance did the trick. Manju picked up his banana leaf and took it to his room. Something something cheap something. Ananyas mother said as Ananya interrupted her. Mom Krish doesnt understand Tamil. Please speak in English Ananya said. Ananyas mother gathered herself and spoke again. Why are you sending your brother away when you are ready to be cheap in public DX www.desibbrg.com I didnt do anything cheap. Chitra is lying I gave him a little kiss. Kissing Ananyas mother said as if Ananya had mentioned us snorting drugs. Mom stop hyperventilating. He is my boyfriend. You understand You are my daughter do you understand You are spoiling our name in the community do you understand I brought you up educated you made sacrifices for you do you understand I dont know if mother and daughter understood anything but I understood it was time for me to go. I stood up. Where are you going Ananya demanded of me. To wash my hands I said showing her my curdfilled hands as proof. Even my hands are messy. Stay with me Ananya ordered. You dont know what I have to bear because of you Ananyas mother said. In one movement she stood up gathered her leaf and composure and left the room. Ananya let out a huge sigh. I liked the rasam nice and tangy I said. You said you owe me big time I said. I sat in Balas office. He kept both his elbows on the desk and ran all ten fingers through his oily hair. But how can i Bala said. You said you are over budget. I have a singer for you free. I played with the paperweight in his office. Alone with him I behaved his equal. Who he said. DX www.desibbrg.com Radha Swaminathan upcoming singer. Really Never heard of her Bala said. She is still in the underground scene. She has trained in Carnatic music. But this is a popular concert. Well have dancers to complement the singers. Bala popular music is cakewalk for Carnatic singers. You know that. Is she good Have you heard her sing Sort of. Sort of Yes I have. Itll be fine. Plus you have Hariharan and S.P. cant go too wrong. Bala stood up and walked towards his window. Is she hot Bala said Like goodlooking She is my girlfriends mother. I find the daughter pretty. What I have to do this Bala. I am hitting alltime low with her. If I dont do something drastic I can kiss my girl goodbye forever. Theyve got a Cisco guy lined up pure as fresh coconut oil. Your girlfriend is Tamilian Yes Brahmin so you can deal with it for once. Iyenger or. Iyer does it matter No Bala said and came back to his seat. Now I know why you came to Chennai. Apart from the fact that I was dying to work with a financial wizard like you I said. What Nothing now are you doing it What DX www.desibbrg.com Finalising the singers Hariharan S.P. and the new talent Radha. What will the agents say We have a committee. Everyone in the committee works for you. They are your drones. But still Bala said in deep thought. You decide I sighed. I have work. I havent cleaned up my mailbox in ages. I still have those emails of yours asking me to push those Internet stocks I should delete them right Bala stared at me as I turned to leave. Look it is not personal I said but this is about my future kids. DX www.desibbrg.com Aunty may I come in I said. Ananyas mother looked at me through the mesh door with sleepy eyes. She wore a nightie I had disturbed her afternoon nap. I had told my agents I would be out for a late lunch. Before coming to their house I stopped at Grand Sweets and packed two kilos of Mysore pak. Aunty opened the door. I came inside. She went inside to change her clothes. I flipped through The Hindu util she returned. Uncles back I asked. He came last night. She yawned. But he is in office now. Sorry to wake you up I said and passed her the box of sweets. Whats this I wanted to apologise for the dinner that night. Aunty kept quiet and looked at the coffee table. I am sorry about the Ratna Stores incident. I assure you nothing cheap happened I said. Chitra is a loudmouth she responded. She would have told the whole of Mylapore by now. I can understand. We have people like that in Punjabis as well. People who love to interfere in other peoples lives. Aunty ignored me. She went inside to keep the sweets in the fridge. She came back with a glass of water and their family dish of hard brittle spirals that didnt taste of anything. I took one. My tooth hurt as I tried to bite it. I took the spiral out of my mouth and faked I had taken a bite by pretending to chew. We had an awkward minute of silence. Aunty I wnted to show you this I said and opened my bag. I took out the Carnatic music CDs and gave them to her. DX www.desibbrg.com T.S. Subramanium Whose is it Mine. What Im trying to develop a taste. Im learning but its hard. Theres the swara the raga the shruti. You know about shruti Only the basics. I am not an expert like you. She returned my CDs and gave a wry smile. In Chennai I am a nobody. Even Chitra is better than me. Though people say she knows the corporator of Chennai who asked Guruji to take her on. The corporator is in charge of the kutcheri venues so Guruji had to oblige her. Can you imagine how shallow she is There have ot be other gurus I said. I was ready for an advanced one. Anyway I am sorry I overreacted that day. No no you dont haave to spologise. I came ot apologise. And for a little request. Request What are you requesting me You young people do whatever you want anyway. Nothis isnt about Ananya and me. This is about our Citibank concert. Over the next half an hour I explained the upcoming event. I told her about the Fishermans Cove venue the whos who of Chennai that we expected to be present the popular music concert for two hours divided between three singers and that I wanted her to be one of them. Me she echoed shocked. Yes I said. Ive never sung popular music she said. You have a trained voice. Switch on MTV and see the latest chartbusters. Three Kollywood three Bollywood. You are done. Why me she asked still bewildered. DX www.desibbrg.com Actually we are desperate. We need three singers and we found only two. My boss gave me the job of finding the third singer. So my appraisal depends on you. Who are the other two singers They are a bit known. So the third one has to be fresh to balance things out. Who hariharan and S.P. Balasubramanium I said. Auntys mouth fell open. She stood up and left the room. I followed her into the kitchen. Aunty it is no big deal. It isnt a public concert. Aunty answerd by placinga frying pan on the stove and poring oil in it. Once the oil heated uo she tossed in mustard seeds and curry leaves. A pungent smell filled the kitchen. I coughed twice. See this is what I do all day. I cook I dont perform. I am an amateur. I cant even sit in front of Hariharan and S.P. let alone share the same stage. Its fun night not a competition. They sing after you. She tossed chopped onions in the pan. My eyes burned along with my throat. aunty have you ever performed on stage before No. OK yes a couple of times in the Tamil Sangam events where Ananyas father was posted. But his fivestar hotel highsociety Hariharan.Youve got Hariharan why do you need me Only professionals will make it too commercial. We want to give our clients a family feel. A casual vibe will be nice I said. Aunty shook her head. I continued to convince her until she had prepared the evening dinner of tomato rasam lemon rice and fried bhindi. I had followed the recipe and could now make rasam from scratch. However I still didnt have her on board. Why are you doing this I accepted you apology didnt i thats not why I am doing it. Then why She covered the dishes with plates. I am doing this because I think you are a good singer. DX www.desibbrg.com How do you know that Because Ananya told me. She also said youve trained all your life. And I believe her. She looked at me. Dont tell me the idea doesnt excite you. Not even a little I said as we came back to the living room. of course it is a huge honour but I cant. Dont say you cant. Cmon we will keep it a surprise. We wont tell uncle. We wont even tell Ananya if you want. We sat down on the sofa. I noticed the whisky bottle the level was the same as I had left it. OK here is the deal. You give a tentative yes now. You prepare the songs when Ananya and uncle are not at home. If on the day of the concert you want to back out let me know the night before and I will manage. If not give it a shot. Deal I will chicken out at the end she promised. Ill take the chance. Please I said. She took ten seconds but she gave a brief nod at the end. I sprang up the sofa in excitement. Cool your practice starts now I said and picked up the remote and put on MTV. What are these songs she said as the screen showed two hundred South Indian dancers dancing on the Great Wall of China. Ill let you figure it out. And now I better go to work I said The Citi never sleeps but the Citi shouldnt bunk office too. I fistpumped as I left Ananyas house. DX www.desibbrg.com People close to you have the power to disturb you the most. I should have torn my fathers letter. I ended up reading it thrice. Son I am omitting the Dear as I am not sure I can address you as that anymore. I knew you are on the wrong path the day you lost respect for your father. I am sure you remember that day. You have broken all contact with me since. I have learnt you are involved with a girl in Chennai. I dont know the details. I can only deduce so much from your mothers conversations with her useless relatives. We should choose the girl for you not you. For you are on the path to becoming a man of low character. Such are the values given to you by your mother and her siblings that you may not even know how disgraceful your actions are. That you chose to hide your actions from me only reinforces that at some level you are ashamed of them as well. Unfortunately Your father I changed my sleeping position for the tenth time. I wanted to sleep but felt more alert than anytime in office. Forget it he only wants to provoke you I said to myself again. Go to sleep now I scolded myself. The funny thing about sleep is you cant instruct it to happen. Your mind knows the facts and repeats them to you it is late only five hours when you have to wake up again you need rest. Your mind also has a million options on what it can think about stars in the clear moonless sky the beautiful flowers at the Nungambakkam flower shop the smell of incense in Ananyas house your best birthday party. There are positive thoughts somewhere in peoples heads all the time. But somehow even one negative thought will crowd them out. Maybe it is an evolutionary mechanism so we can focus on the problem at hand rather than rejoice in all things wonderful. But it makes life a bitch as good memories have to make space for the next pain DX www.desibbrg.com in the neck item. And what does one gain by losing sleep I hope our genes mutate ASAP so we can evolve out of this. Memories of that day my father referred to kept coming back. What drama is he going to do when I tell him about my marriage plans I thought. Go to sleep idiot only four hours to wake up my mind scolded me. My brain refused to relax. I sprang out of the bed at two and called home. Hello my mother said in a sleepy voice. Sorry it is me. Krish Everything OK she sounded panicked. Yes I said. What happened Dad sent me a letter. Im quite disturbed. Oh really What did it say Not important. He knows about Ananya. Your friend no yes so what Mom she is not just a friend. I want to marry her. Oh Krish dont start this so late at night. A girlfriend is fine do whatever you want in Chennai. But why are you forcing her on us I am not imposing. I am telling you about my choice of life partner I said my voice loud. Stop screaming. Im sorry. If you have the guts shout at your father. I dont speak to him at all. You know I dont care. Then why is that letter bothering you I kept silent. Hello my mother said after five seconds. DX www.desibbrg.com Im here I said my voice soft. Are you OK I held back my tears as I spoke. Im lonely mom. I dont need this form dad. Tear the letter and throw it. I am battling Ananyas parents here anyway. This is such a strange city I am welcome nowhere. And now you think I am imposing on you I said and couldnt control myself. I held the phone tight and cried. Stop Krish dont my mother said. I composed myself and used my left leg to open the fridge. I took out a bottle of water and drank it. What do I do I said after I regained composure. Come back. Why dont you apply for a transfer back to Delhi I only came here six months ago. Say you have family issues. Tell them I am sick. Mom please. Leave your job if you have to. Well find another one. There is a Canara Bank right across our house. Mom Im in Citibank. It is an MNC. Fine we will look for a multinational. Swear on me you will ask for a transfer. Dont be trapped in the city with horrible black people. Mom they are not all bad. I dont care. Apply for a transfer or I will send a letter to your boss. I will say I am an old woman and you have to consider my plea on humanitarian grounds. Mom swear on me you will never do anything like that I said and smiled at her choice of words inspired by Indian government offices. Then you do it. I will mom. I have to finish a few things first. I am almost there I said and regained my composure. OK you fine now she said. DX www.desibbrg.com Yes I am good. Good. And dont take any nonsense from these Madrasis give it back to them. They get scared fast. OK mom. And dont get serious about that girl. Already too late for that mom I thought. Good night mom I said. I love you. Good night she said and hung up. I came back to my bed and tossed the letter in the bin. I felt light after speaking to my mother and drifted off to sleep in five minutes. What would the world be without mothers DX www.desibbrg.com Bike Ananya beamed when I went to pick her up on a black Yamaha RX . Balas I said. Ananya sat pillion in a maroon salwar kameez using her white dupatta to cover her head and face. She looked like a member of Veerappans gang. Pondicherry is a hundred and forty kilometres away from Chennai down the East Coast Road or ECR running along the Bay of Bengal. Fishermans Cove falls on the way twenty kilometres outside Chennai city. We left Ananyas office at Anna Salai. She sat behind me and held the sidebars tight. By the time we left the city at Lattice Bridge Road she switched from gripping the sidebars to my shoulders. We took the Old Mahabalipuram Road which led us to ECR. This is beautiful I said as the sea became visible. I told you. Ananya planted a kiss on the back of my neck. We halted at Fishermans Cove where I met the catering manager briefly. Everything seemed under control for the Citibank event. We left the resort and came on the ECR again. An hour of driving later we passed Mahabalipuram. It had stunning rockcut temples next to the sea. Wow these are amazing temples I said as the wind swept back my hair. The ECR ended an hour after Mahabalipuram. The roads became narrower. We passed several little towns with long names and sprawling paddy fields. At a few places I had to stop to make way for bullock carts village school kids and goatherds. We reached Pondicherry around noon and my first reaction was disappointment. This is it I asked as I reached the main chowk in the town. It was like any other small town in India dusty and noisy with Cola ad signs painted on uneven walls. The nice part is inside the French quarter and the Aurobindo Ashram Ananya said as I negotiated a sharp bend in the road along with fifty other twowheelers and four trucks. DX www.desibbrg.com The only French I saw was an underwear billboard with the brand Frenchie. Drop me here Ananya said as we passed Cuddalore road where HLL has one of its factories. I had three hours to kill in this Malgudi town as Ananya had an extended lunch meeting. We had agreed to meet at the LOrient hotel at four for coffee. I drove out of the factory compound and followed the signs to the Aurobindo Ashram on Rue de la Marine. The Ashram building resembled a quiet hostel by the sea. I came to the reception. More foreigners than Indian thronged the ashram lobby. A fortyyear old Western woman in a sari and beaded necklace sat at the counter. What are you looking for she asked me. Maybe because I was in an ashram or because the way she said it I suspected deeper meaning in her question. I looked at her. She had blue eyes with wrinkles around them. Ive come for the first time I confessed. She gave me Ashram brochure. Another person came and bought meal tickets. Can I get lunch here I asked. Yes at the Ashram Dining Hall she said and showed me the coupon booklet. I bought one for myself. Come Im going there she said walking out with me from the reception. We walked along a lane adjacent to the ashram. The dining hall was half a kilometre away. She told me her name was Diana and that she came from Finland. A former lawyer she now found more satisfaction as a volunteer at the ashram than helping Nokia secure patents. Are you a seeker or here as a tourist She handed me my coupon. Seeker Yes if you wish to seek your path. Or if you seek answers to a specific problem. Frankly I came with a friend who had some work here. I wanted a day away from office. Diana laughed. We reached the dining hall and picked our stainless steel plates. We entered the eating area where everyone sat on the floor. Lunch was simple organic brown rice yellow daal and a carrot and peas subzi. DX www.desibbrg.com OK so I seek an answer. How do I get it Well the answers are within us. People stay in the ashram for a few weeks to introspect they attend satsang and ask questions of one of the gurus. How much time do you have I need to meet my girlfriend for coffee in two hours. Then head back to Chennai. Diana smiled and shook her head. Thats a pretty stiff deadline to sort out lifes unresolved answers. Maybe I shouldnt even try then I said. Wait see the gentleman there she said and pointed to a seventyyearold man in white robes who sat two rows ahead of us. He is a guru. Maybe I can introduce to him. No no please dont I said. Why not If he is busy he will say no. Pranam Guruji Diana said and touched his feet. I followed suit and he blessed us. Guruji this is my friend. His name is Diana said and paused. Krish. Yes he has only two hours. But he wanted to seek answers to some problems Diana said. What do you have to do in two hours Guruji asked his voice calm. He has to meet his girlfriend Diana said excitedly stressing on the last word. And surely the girlfriend is more important than the problem Guruji smiled. Actually she is the problem I said. Diana threw me a puzzled look. Not her. But her family I said. Its OK. I know it is very little time. Send him to my house in fifteen minutes Guruji said and left. DX www.desibbrg.com I hovered at the open door of Gurujis house before walking in. Come in Krish Guruji said. He sat on a daybed in his living room. I had thought Id be roaming around French cafs in Pondicherry. I had no idea Id end up in a gurus house. The tiny house had sparse wooden furniture. You may find it strange to be here. But Id like to think we were destined to meet Guruji said. Do you read minds I wanted to know. I read people. Your nervousness is obvious. Sit he said and stroked his white beard. I sat crosslegged on the floor facing him. What is bothering you My girlfriend is Tamilian I am Punjabi. Our families are against our marriage. I am doing whatever I can but it is stressful. Hmmm Guruji said. Close your eyes and speak whatever comes to mind. I love her I said and we make each other happy. But if our happiness makes so many people unhappy is it the right thing to do I rambled for some more time Guruji didnt make any sound. Since my eyes were closed I had no idea if he was even around anymore. She is my future I concluded. Is that all You are there I countered. Are you sure this is the only problem that is bothering you What do you mean There is a lot of pain in you unresolved issues. Before you build a future you must fix the past. What are you talking about I opened my eyes. Gurujis eyes were shut. DX www.desibbrg.com Close your eyes Guruji said. I have I said and shut them again. What keeps you awake at night I kept quiet. Do you take a long time to go to sleep he probed. Yes I said. What kept you awake lately Various things. There is work which I am not exactly exited about. Theres uncertainty about Ananya. Theres my father. What about your father Its complicated I said. And a heavy load isnt it I sighed deeply. Let it go Guruji said. I cant. I dont want to. I havent even talked about it. Im listening Guruji said. He bent forward and placed his palm on my head. I felt a new lightness. I felt transported to another world. It was as if my soul had disowned my body. Guruji dont make me do it I begged not wishing to revisit the pain that awaited me. Go on Im listening. Guruji said. DX www.desibbrg.com Three years ago My father came home at midnight. I had waited for hours. I didnt have time I had to talk to him tonight. He refused dinner with a wave of his hand and sat on the living room sofa to take off his shoes. Dad I said my voice low I wore shorts and a white Tshirt. The Tshirt had a tiny hole at the shoulder. What he turned to me. Is this what you wear at home These are my nightclothes I said. You dont have proper nightclothes I changed the topic. Dad I want to talk about something. What I like a girl. Obviously you have time to waste he said. Its not like that. She is a nice girl. An IIT professors daughter. Oh so now we know what you did at IIT. Ive graduated. I have a job. Im preparing for MBA. Whats the problem I dont have a problem. You wanted to talk he said not looking at me. The girls father is taking her abroad. Theyll get her engaged to someone else. Oh so her father doesnt approve of it. No. Why I looked at the floor. We had some issues with him me and my friends. What issues Disciplinary issues DX www.desibbrg.com Yes I said. Shocking. The son of an army officer has disciplinary issues. All the reputation I have built youll destroy it. Those issues are history now. Then why does he have a problem Does your mother know about this Yes I said. Why hasnt she told me Kavita my father screamed. My mother came to the room woken from a deep sleep. What happened Why was I not informed about this girl earlier my father screamed. He told me only a few weeks ago my mother said. And you hid it from me bitch my father said. Dont talk to mom like that I said in reflex. I would have said more but I need him today. My mother broke into tears. This wasnt going well at all. Dad please. I want your cooperation. If you meet her father he may reconsider. Why should I meet anyone he said. Because I love her. And I dont want her to go away. You are distracted not in love. Leave it Krish he wont listen. See how he talks to me. You dont know how I lived when you were in hostel. My father lunged menacingly towards my mother. He raised a hand to hit her. I pulled my mother behind me. Dont I said. Who do you think you are he slapped me hard on my right cheek. I sat down on the dining room chair. Leave us and go. Why do you even come back My mother folded her hands at him. Dont beg mom I said fighting a lump in my throat. My father had made fun of me earlier for crying. To him only weak men cried. DX www.desibbrg.com Look at his voice like a girls my father mocked. He gave me a disgusted glance and went to the bathroom to change. Go to sleep son my mother said. He is sending her away next week I said. What girl have you involved yourself with You are so young my mother said. I am not marrying her tomorrow. Is she Punjabi my mother asked. No I said. What she said shocked as if Id suggested she wasnt human. Will you meet her father once My father came out of the bathroom. He had heard my last sentence Dont you dare go anywhere Kavita my father said his eyes wild. I stared back at him. Go to your room my father said. I came back to my bed. I heard noises in my parents room. I couldnt sleep. I woke up and came towards their room. Id heard enough arguments of my parents throughout my life to care but I placed my ear at the door anyway. He is growing up my mother said. With all the wrong values. What does he know about this girl He is my son he is from IIT see what deal I get for him at the right time. There it was for all my fathers principles I was his trophy to be sold in the market to the highest bidder. You are responsible for bringing him up like this my father screamed at my mother. I heard the sound of a glass being smashed against the wall. What have I done I didnt even know about this girl. Slap slap my father interrupted my mother. I banged the door open as I heard a few more slaps. I saw my mothers hand covering her face. A piece of glass had cut her forearm. My father turned to me. Dont you have any manners Cant you knock DX www.desibbrg.com You dont teach me manners I said. Go away he said. I shook my head. I saw the tears on my mothers face. My face burned with rage. She had lived with this for twentyfive years. I did know why to bring me up I didnt know how she did it. My father lifted his hand to hit me. Automatically I grabbed his wrist tight. Oh now you are going to raise your hand against your own father he said. I twisted his arm. Leave him he wont change my mother panted. I shook my head at her my eyes staring right into his. I slapped his face once twice then I rolled my hand into a fist and punched his face. My father went into a state of shock he couldnt fight back. He didnt expect this all my childhood Id merely suffered his dominance. Today it wasnt just about the broken glass. It wasnt only that the girl I loved would be gone. It was a reaction to two decades of abuse. Or thats how I defended it to myself. For how else do you justify hitting your own father At that moment I couldnt stop. I punched his head until he collapsed on the floor. I couldnt remember the last time I reveled in violence like this. I was a studious child who stayed with his books all his life. Today I was lucky there wasnt a gun at home. This insanity passed after five minutes. My father didnt make eye contact with me. He sat on the floor and massaged the arm I had twisted. He stared at my mother with a see I told you expression. My mother sat on the bed fighting back her emotions. We looked at each other. We were a family but pretty screwed up as they come. I took a broom and swept the broken glass into a newspaper sheet. I looked at my father and vowed never to speak to him again. I picked up the newspaper with the glass pieces and left the room. DX www.desibbrg.com Thats it Guruji I said tears now dry on my face. Ive never shared so much with anyone. The sound of the sea could be heard the waves asymmetrical to my tumultuous thoughts. Open your eyes Guruji said. I lifted my eyelids slowly. Come we will go to the balcony behind Guruji said. I followed him to a terrace in the rear of the house. The sea breeze felt cool even in the hot sun. I sat on one of the two stools kept outside. He went inside and came back with two glasses and a book. Its coconut water. And this is the Gita. Youve heard about the Gita Yes I said sort of. I took a sip of the coconut water. What have you heard Like it is the ultimate book. It has all of lifes wisdom. You have to work and not worry about the reward. Right Have you read it Parts of it. Its nice but a little. Boring Actually no not boring. Hard to follow and apply everything. Ill give you just one word to apply in your life. What Forgiveness. Meaning You want me to forgive my father I cant. Why not DX www.desibbrg.com Because what he did was so wrong. He has ruined my mothers life. He has never loved me. I am not saying he did the right thing. I am asking you to forgive him. Why For you. Forgiving doesnt make the person who hurt you feel better it makes you feel better. I pondered over his words. Close your eyes again Guruji said. Imagine you have bags on your head. They are bags of anger pain and loss. How do they feel Heavy I sighed. Remove them from your head one by one Guruji said. Imagine you are wearing a thick cloak that is wearing you down. Pardon the hurt others have caused you. What they did is past. What is bothering you today are your current feelings that come from this load. Let it go. Strange as Gurujis metaphors were I felt compelled to obey the imagery in my mind. My head felt lighter. And surrender to God he went on. You dont control anything or anyone. I dont understand I said. Do you control your life Your life depends on so many internal organs functioning right. You have no control on them. If your lungs dont cooperate if your kidneys fail if your heart stops it is all over. Youll drop dead now. God has chosen to give you the gift of life surrender to him. He kept me in meditation for the next few minutes. And now you are free to go Guruji smiled. I opened my eyes. The sharp afternoon sun shone on Gurujis face. He went inside and brought a small cup with grey ask. He dipped his index finger in the ash and marked my forehead. Thank you I said as he blessed me with his hand on my head. You are welcome he said. Anything else I can help you with Yes which way is Hotel LOrient DX www.desibbrg.com Oh that Guruji laughed It is on Rue Romain Rolland. One kilometre from here. I reached LOrient at four. Ananya was waiting at the entrance. The hotel is a renovated heritage building and was originally the Education Department Office when the French had colonised Pondicherry. Now a tenroom boutique property it had a small restaurant in the indoor open patio. We ordered coffee and a slice of ginger cake with custard sauce. Isnt this place lovely Ananya breathed in deeply. I nodded still deep in though. So tell me what did you do And whats with the tilak on your forehead I hit my father. What A long time ago. Remember how I would always avoid talking about my father in campus Yes and I never pushed after that she said. But what are you saying I repeated the story of that night. She looked at me awestruck Oh dear I didnt know your parents were like this. I nvever told you. Its fine. Are you OK she said and moved her hand forward to hold me. Yes I am fine. And I met a Guruji who gave me good advice. What Who Guruji what advice Ananya said. I dont know the Guruji. It doesnt matter. Sometimes in your life you just meet someone or hear something that nudges you on the right path. And that becomes the best advice. It could just be a bit of common sense said in a way that resonates with something in you. Its nothing new but because it connects with you it holds meaning for you. DX www.desibbrg.com I explained with such intensity Ananya became concerned. Are you OK baby I shouldnt have left you. Im fine. Im glad I had time. I feel better. I love you she said brushing floppy hair off my face. I love you too I said and clasped her hand tight. Our order arrived she cut the cake in two pieces and passed my half to me. I wanted to change the topic. She read my mind. So tell me about this Citibank event. There is a concert Yes I said only for clients though. Do I get to come Of course Ill get passes for your family. Who is performing S.P. Balasubramanium Hariharan and. I paused. Wow those are big names. Who else Some new singer. Cool Im sure mom and dad will love to come. I nodded. I spoke after a few more sips of coffee. Ive tried enough Ananya. I want to go back. I told her about my conversation with my mother about transferring back to Delhi. What do you mean she said wiping my milk moustache. I cant work in Chennai forever. Ill give it a few more weeks and then Ill tell your parents to take a call on me. Weeks What if they say no Then well see. Ive surrendered everything to God anyway. What DX www.desibbrg.com Nothing lets go. I want to hit the road while theres still light. I picked up my helmet. DX www.desibbrg.com Aunty sorry to bother you but the concert is next week I said over the phone. I had called Ananyas mother from my office in the afternoon. I had the design of the newspaper ad in my hand. Citibank Priority Banking is pleased to invite its clients To an enchanting musical evening at Fishermans Cove Featuring maestros S.P. Balasubramanium Hariharan And new talent Radha The concert will be followed by dinner. By invitation only. For passes contact your customer rep or any of the branches. Note New account holders who open an account before the concert will also get invites. I hated the last line as it was too blatant. However Bala insisted on it. Hello aunty You there I said. What have you trapped me in Ananyas mother wailed. You are practicing right Yes but. But what Have you done any Kaho Na Pyaar Hai songs Those are hot I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Yes I have. Film songs are easy. It is my confidence. Youll be fine. I am sending the ad to the newspaper today. Your name is in it without surname as you insisted. It will come on Sunday the day of the concert. Dont dont put my name. What if I decide not to come she asked with a touch of panic. Its fine. There are plenty of Radhas in Chennai. Nobody will know which one did not show up I said. Ill let you down she said. You wont. I said. Until when can you remove my name from the ad Saturday. Dont think like that please I said. OK still wanted to check she said. Fine and practice the Ek Pal Ka Jeena song. It is number one on the charts I said. I said take my name out Ananyas mother called me on Sunday morning at a.m. You saw the ad already I rubbed my eyes. I picked up The Hindu from under the chummery entrance door. I opened Metroplus the Sunday supplement. Yes she whispered. What is this She had called when uncle had gone for a bath. Ananya hadnt woken up and Manju huddled in his room with his best friends Physics Chemistry and Maths. I couldnt do it I said and made up a story. The newspaper told me Metroplus goes to press two days before. Only the main paper can be changed until the night before. So what are we going to do now She had called me the previous morning to get her name removed. However I never called the newspaper to change the ad wordings. Nothing well just say Radha fell ill I said. She kept silent. Wont it make you look bad she enquired after a pause. DX www.desibbrg.com Yeah wont be the first time though. Ill manage. Anyway all of you will come for the concert right I said. OK listen if I do have to perform where and when do I have to report My heart started to beat fast. She was going to do it. Aunty everything is well organised. We have a room next to the concert garden that will act as the greenroom. Come there three hours early by four. OK Yes she said. Thanks aunty I said. I should thank you. I havent told anyone at home yet. Good make an excuse and leave the house. See you. DX www.desibbrg.com Which one should I wear Ananyas mother asked sitting on the kingsize bed of the cottage we had converted into a greenroom. The makeup artists sound engineers and the staff of Hariharan and S.P. had already arrived. The main singers would come only at the last minute. However Radha had come early and laid out three Kanjeevaram silk saris for me to choose from. They are all beautiful I said. The first was purple and gold the second yellow and gold and the third orange and gold. Touchup madam the makeup man came towards Ananyas mother. I should leave the room I said. Even though we had half a dozen people around I felt awkward watching my potential motherinlaw applying mascara. Im so tense I cant choose she said wiping sweat off her forehead. The makeup man applied foundation on Ananyas mothers cheeks. I tried not to look. Take the orange nice and bright. Thats my wedding sari. Ive hardly worn it since that day. Tonights quite special too. The makeup man sprayed water on her forehead and wiped it. Ill be outside. Ill see you on stage. She closed her eyes and folded her hands to pray. I came outside and checked the food arrangements. I called Ananya at six to make sure they left on time. You are going to kill me Ananya said. Why I said. Mom is not coming. Why I said careful to sound upset. DX www.desibbrg.com She said my grandmother fell ill in Thirukudayur. She left after lunch. Where is Thirukudayur Six hours form Chennai. She wont be able to make it. What about you guys We are almost ready. I wanted to wear my moms nice orange Kanjeevaram sari but I cant find it. I hope she has not lost it. She wouldnt take it with her hardly the occasion. Leave soon Ananya I cant promise good seats otherwise I said. OK OK bye she said and hung up. Bala arrived at with Anil Mathur the country manager. Anil had flown down from Mumbai. Bala had ensured that a Mercedes brought Anil straight to the venue. Bala tailed him like a Tamil villains sidekick showing him the arrangements and taking credit for the entire event. And this is the bar. And see the Citibank banner behind. I put a big ad in The Hindu today. Number one newspaper here Bala said. I greeted Bala. He ignored me and continued to walk. Hey you are the Internet fiasco guy Anil noticed me. Good evening sir I said. I had become the poster boy for loserdom in the bank. Arent you the only Punjabi stuck here he laughed. I think thats enough punishment. No Bala Bala guffawed even though the joke was on him rather his city. Looking to move back the country manager said. Ill talk to you about it sir I said. You let me know first Bala finally acknowledged me. Ill help him sir. The country manager patted my shoulder and walked away. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya arrived with her father and brother at .. Are we late she asked breathlessly. She wore a peach chiffon sari with a skinny silver border. She had accessorised with a silver necklace and matching earrings. Yes but the concert hasnt started yet. Come I said. I led them to one of the several round tables laid out in the garden. I chose one near the stage. Food is that side and uncle the bar is that way I said. I dont drink uncle said looking at Ananya. Sure. I said. Clients filled each of the ten seats on all eighteen tables. One or two bank agents sat at every table comprising primarily of junior Chennai Citibankers. Bala and the country manager had a separate table with the biggest clients those with assets of five crore or more. I felt sorry for these clients. Frankly Id rather not be rich than face the agony of having dinner with senior bankers. The lights dimmed at .. Conversations stopped at the round tables as Bala came on stage. He wore a shiny cream silk shirt under his suit and resembled a pimp in training. Welcome everyone what a delightful evening I am Bala regional manager for the Priority Banking Group he said and wiped the sweat off his face. Your boss Ananya whispered to me. I nodded. Whats with the shirt Shsh I said. Manju and Ananyas father listened to Bala with full attention. I want to welcome someone special Bala said. The crowd cheered as they expected Hariharan or S.P to take the stage. Please welcome Mr Anil Mathur country manager and MD Citibank India The crowd let out a collective sigh of disappointment. Anil came on stage and realised that no one cared about him. He attempted a joke. Hello everyone who would have thought some of our biggest clients will come from the land of dosas and idlis DX www.desibbrg.com The crowd fell so silent you could hear the waves on the adjacent beach. Ananya looked at me shocked. I shrugged my shoulders. I had no control over this. Anil realised the joke didnt work and attempted a rescue. You see in Bombay idli and dosa are seen as simple snacks Anil said. Hes digging himself in deeper Ananya said. Yes luckily he has only five minutes. Anil realised his sense of humour only worked with people who worked under him. He switched to what bankers do best present boring PowerPoint slides with growing bar charts. So you see when we came to Chennai we started with a tiny footprint and now we are a giant. From a mini idli we have become a paper dosa Anil said gesturing with his hands to show the relative sizes of the two dishes. Please someone stop him Ananya groaned. We cant. He is the boss I said. Anil finished his speech and the staff applauded hard. The clients waited in pain as two clueless but confident research analysts spoke about global corporate outlook for the next ten years. If we assume a seven percent GDP growth rate the picture is like this the analyst said. Nobody questioned how the seven percent assumption came about but after that the analyst had enough charts to show what happens if the growth rate is indeed seven percent. We ended the presentations at . People started to get restless as Bala came on stage again. Not another banker you could almost hear them think. And now for the music concert we have a separate MC Miss T.S. Smitha Bala said. The crowd applauded as the extra busty Smitha came on the stage. She wore a lowcut blouse a tad too deep for Citibank sensibilities. Welcome ladies and gentlemen Smitha said holding the mike in her hand. Are you having a good time Nobody responded. DX www.desibbrg.com What is she wearing Ananya said. Our whole table heard and sniggered. It is a little provocative I admit I said. Her cleavage is so big she can use it to hold the mike. Handsfree Ananya whispered to me. Shut up Ananya I said suppressing a smile. We have three talented singers tonight Smitha said. My heart beat fast. We are all of course waiting for the maestros. But the first singer is the new very talented Radha. Please welcome her on stage. The crowd applauded as I craned my neck to see the stage. Ananyas mother arrived on stage in the orange sari. Its mom Manju noticed first as he stood up. DX www.desibbrg.com What Ananyas father stood up as well. Ananya looked at the stage and then me in quick succession. Krish what is. Shsh pay attention I placed a finger on my lips. Radha took the mike. Mom Manju screamed. Ananyas mother looked towards us and smiled. What are you going to sing for us first Radha Smitha asked coyly. Ek pal ka jeena from Kaho Na Pyaar Hai Ananyas mother answered shyly. The crowd roared and clapped as introductory music began for the song. Radha aunty sang well I noticed several clients tap their feet or nod their heads to the music. Tamilians can tell good singers from bad like Punjabis can judge butter chicken in a jiffy. Nobody in the audience looked disapproving. How did Radha come here Ananyas father spoke after recovering from the shock. Obviously Krish arranged it dad. Cant you guess Ananya said. She never told me uncle said. But his eyes glinted with pride. Mom is singing so well Ananya said to Manju who nodded and reached out for the various snacks ferried by waiters. Ananya bent forward and kissed me on my cheek. Her father didnt notice as his eyes were transfixed on stage. A few agents did and I smiled in embarrassment. Ananya this is an office event I whispered. Of course thats why my mother is on stage she said as she played footsie with me. DX www.desibbrg.com Her mother switched to the latest Tamil hit number from Rajnis movie. The crowds excitement rose further. The song was a slow ballad and required a lot of voice modulation. Claps ran through the crowd as Ananyas mother maneuvered a tough range of notes. Lovely beautiful Ananyas father said in reflex as Ananyas mother switched three octaves in one line. Ananyas mother sang four more songs to finish her act. Each song ended with enthusiastic applause. Smitha came on stage again. That was wonderful Radha. And before you leave Id like to invite the next singer Mr S.P. Balasubramanium who has a few words to say about you. The crowd rose to its feet and applauded as one of South Indias greatest singers took the stage. Radha aunty folded her hands and bowed to him. S.P. said Good evening Chennai and thank you Citibank. Before I begin I want to praise Radha for her wonderful singing. The songs were popular but I can see she has a strong classical base. Do you sing often Radha No first time like this. Well you should sing more. Shouldnt she Chennai Everyone banged their tables in support. Ananyas mother bowed to everyone. As she straightened her eyes were filled with tears. So you will S.P. said as he pointed the mike to Radha. Yes I will. Also sir I want to say that today is the happiest day of my life. Ive shared the stage with you. The crowd clapped. Radha aunty fought back tears as she left the dais. And I thought her happiest day was the day I was born Ananya muttered as she continued to clap. The evening progressed with S.P. and Hariharan casting their spell on the crowd. For everyone else the main act had just begun. For me and Ananyas family the main act was over. Ananyas mother joined us at the table after ten minutes. DX www.desibbrg.com You were wonderful a lady at the next table said to Ananyas mother. Ananyas father exchanged shy glances with his wife. S.P. sang Tere mere beech mein from Ek Duje Ke Liye. I looked at Ananya. Our struggle resembled that films story. I only hoped our end wouldnt resemble that movies climax. An hour into the concert Bala came to my table. Krish come with me. I want you to meet Mr Muruguppa famous jeweler Bala said. What I said. Come he wants to open a tencrore account. Give him some bull on Citi. I have to drop Anil at the airport. Sir I have guests I said as Ananya noticed my dilemma. Its fine we will manage. Dinners over there right Ananya said. Oh so she is the one Bala said and turned to Ananya. Tamil teria Lets go Bala I said. I met Mr Muruguppa a fat jovial fiftyyearold. Punjabi Tamil ille he said and gave me his card. No. So you are the jewellery king What king Emperor We are the biggest in Chennai. Sir regarding your account I said as I noticed Ananyas family from a distance. They laughed together over dinner. Several people came up to congratulate Ananyas mother. The time to strike was not far away. Mr Muruguppa actually I may need some jewellery myself I said as I led him to the dinner table. DX www.desibbrg.com Oh trust me she is on a different planet since that day. No need for dinner to thank her Ananya said over the phone. We were in our respective offices. I had just invited Ananyas family for dinner. But we didnt even pay her for the concert. Thats the least I can do I said. You have done a lot Ananya said. Trust me the dinner is important I said. Really Whats up Youll find out next Friday at Raintree. See you all at eight I said. The Raintree restaurant is located in the Taj Connemara hotel on Binny Road off Anna Salai. The outdoor restaurant is snug under a canopy of trees of the same name. Fairylights adorn the branches of the trees and candles light up the tables. Apart from Amethyst it is one other oasis in the city. I sat with Ananyas family at one of the outdoor tables my trouser pockets heavy. This is stunning Ananya said as she looked up at the little lights. She wore a white fitted dress with sequins that reflected in the semidarkness. Youve never come here before I said. No we havent. Right dad Uncle shook his head even as he admired the foliage right above us. Uniformed waiters served us a welcome drink of coconut water with fresh mint. They left the menu cards on our tables. The restaurant specialises in Chettinad food named after a region south of Tamil Nadu. The cuisine is known for its intense spices and flavours along with a large range of nonvegetarian preparations. DX www.desibbrg.com Sir for cocktails Id recommend Kothamalli Mary the waiter said. Kothawhat I asked. It is like a Bloody Mary sir tomato juice and vodka but with Chettinad spices. I looked at uncle. He looked reluctant to nod for alcohol in front of his wife. I want one Ananya said. Ananyas mother gave her a sharp look. Cmon just one cocktail Ananya said. I opened the menu. I couldnt pronounce the tonguetwister names of the dishes. Specials included kuruvapillai year and kozhi melagu Chettinad. I didnt bother reading the rest. You know this food better please order I said. Ananyas parents looked at the menu several times. Its too expensive Ananyas mother said. Its fine I said. Ananya please. Ananya took the menu and ordered for everyone. We ordered kozhakattai masala paniyaram adikoozh kandharappam seeyam and athirasam. Of course I had no clue what went into those dishes I figured at least one of them would be edible. The waiter also suggested we order idiyappam rice noodles bunched up like a birds nest. How is the IIT preparation Manju I asked after the waiter left. Good I came tenth in the Mylapore mock IIT test Manju said. I nodded. So any more singing offers I said to aunty. Aunty smiled. Dont embarrass me. But I did find another Guruji who has a modern approach to Carnatic music. I turned to Ananyas dad. Hows the bank uncle Good your presentation is still being talked about. The food arrived spicy tangy and delicious. DX www.desibbrg.com This is great I said as I had the masala paniyaram a tastier cousin of the idli and shaped like a ball. The Raintree staff brought a trolley with ten chutneys to choose from. I swear Delhi needs to taste this. We havent gone past the paneer masala dosa yet I said as I took a spoonful of the tomato tamarind curry with idiyappams. You like it I can make it at home Ananyas mother said. I realised that the right moment was near. Maybe at dessert I told myself. We scanned the dessert menu. Ananyas father chose a coconut icecream. The deep love for this fruit among South Indians is inexplicable. The icecream arrived in an actual green coconut shell. Superb Ananyas father said a signal I took as ready getset go. I want to talk about something important I said. Ananyas father looked up from his icecream. If it is OK I amended. Uncle nodded. Ananyas mother looked at Ananya and me. Manju you too I said. He kept his face so close to the icecream bowl his spectacles were smeared. I had everyones attention. Hi I cleared my throat. Uncle aunty Manju I came here six months ago. It is no secret why I chose Chennai as my first posting. However I cannot stay here forever. I met Ananya almost three years ago and apart from our first fight Ive loved her every day since that day. Ananya took my hand in hers from under the table. And we thought our love is enough reason for us to get married. We thought our parents will meet at the convocation and things will be smooth. Well we were wrong. The waiter came to collect the icecream plates. I told him to come five minutes later. We could have run away. We could have forced our decision on you. However Ananya told me she had this dream of both sets of parents smiling on our DX www.desibbrg.com wedding day. And so I want to see if we can do that. Also I didnt think we had done anything wrong that we had to run away. Ananyas parents kept a deadly silence. Either they were listening carefully or the icecream had been too cold. And ever since I came to Chennai I have tried to be accepted by you. I dont expect you to love me like you do Harish but at least you can accept me. Ananyas mother wanted to talk. I signaled her to wait. And while you may not love me I dont want you to merely tolerate me either. Somewhere in the middle lies the acceptance I am talking about. I slid my right hand inside my trouser pocket and collected the four mini boxes with my fingers. Keeping all that in mind considering your daughters happiness and taking a view of what you know of me I said and paused to breathe. I took out the four little red boxes and kept them on the table. The boxes said Muruguppa Jewellers on top. I opened the four boxes. Each had a gold ring. I stood up from my chair and kneeled on the floor. I Krish Malhotra would like to propose to all of you. Will all of you marry me I said and held the four boxes in my palm. Ananyas parents looked at her and me in quick succession. Manjus mouth was open the coconut icecream very visible inside. Ananyas father gestured to Ananya on what to do. After you mom and dad Ananya said and Manju you too. Manju picked up his box. Nice real gold he asked. I nodded. Argentum atomic number seventynine Manju said as he held the ring inhis hand. Uncle I prompted. My knees had started to hurt on the concrete floor. if you promise to take care of my daughter Ananyas father said then it is a yes from me. He bent forward and picked up his box. Ananya hugged her father. Thanks dad she said I love you. Ananyas father blessed her with a hand on her head. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananyas mother said It is not that we dont like you. But our communities. Mom cmon Ananya interrupted her. Ananyas mother took a minute to respond. I know he will take care of you. But will Krishs parents treat my daughter with respect Well work on that too I said aware another challenge awaited me in Delhi. If they do then Then it is a yes form me Ananyas mother said. Yay Ananya cheered. Aunty took her ring and Ananya planted a kiss on her mothers forehead. Akka you havent picked yours Manju said as the motherdaughter affection continued. When they separated both had tears in their eyes. Oh of course where is it Ananya picked up her ring. I came back to my seat. Sir did you enjoy your meal the waiter said as he cleared the plates. You bet I did I said tipping him more than the bill that night. DX www.desibbrg.com I will miss you Bala said as he handed me my transfer papers in his office. I wish I could say the same I said. Balas chin dropped. I am kidding cheer up. I wont be there to blackmail you anymore I said. Bala had agreed to make my case with Anil Mathur for the same reason. My transfer to Delhi took two months to execute. I wanted to be home soon. After all I had finished my Chennai job. Of course we had a few more battles to win. Ananya would have to deal with the full force of Punjabiness. However life is best dealt with one disaster at a time. Operation Delhi would have to be quick. Ananya convinced her bosses to send her to Delhi for a week. After all every HLL manager must have North India exposure Ananya had argued. Ananyas parents came to drop us at t he airport. Ananyas mother worried about Delhi given its status as the worldwide capital of eveteasing. Mom the HLL guesthouse is safe. I wont be out much Ananya said. Ananyas dad had his won concerns. Remember we have said yes. But you are not married yet. Dont embarrass us uncle said to me as he bid us goodbye. Of course uncle I said trying to figure out what he meant. No sex I guess. Ananya and I went inside the terminal. She grabbed my arm as her parents melted out of sight. The flight took off. I brought out my notebook to explain the next stage to Ananya Operation Delhi. So I have to agree with your mom whatever she says. Like whatever Ananya said twenty minutes into the flight and thirty thousand feet high in the sky. The plane passed through an area of turbulence. Yes never disagree I said tightening my seatbelt and the timing of your trip could not be better. My cousin sister Minti is getting married next week. Youll come to the wedding meet everyone bingo done. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya lifted the armrest to hold my arm tight. Im sure Ill be fine with you. See you have to win over my mother. My father wont agree ever so he is not part of the equation. Make mom happy OK Lower the armrest it is not safe the flight attended said in a strict voice as she passed the aisle. When you are part of a couple you dont realise how cheesy your affections are to the outside world. Who does she think she is Ananya huffed. My mother No the airhostess. Whats with the thick red lipstick Is she a flight attendant or an item girl I dont know why women love commenting on other womens appearances. I never noticed the bald man next to me who snores through the flight. Focus Ananya. You are dealing with a Punjabi motherinlaw here. You have never seen anything like this I said. Cant wait Ananya said sarcasm dripping from her mouth like the airhostesss lipstick. DX www.desibbrg.com ACT Delhi Reloaded DX www.desibbrg.com Let go of my elbow I said. Why Ananya said. I see my mother. Mother waited at the arrival area. She stood among ten thousand drivers holding placards with every Punjabi name possible. There were no more Venkats and Ramaswamis only Aroras and Khannas. When people land at Chennai airport they exchange smiles and proceed gently to the car park. At Delhi there is a traffic jam of people trying to hug each other to death. My mother hugged me tight and even though it was over the top I liked it. No one had hugged me like that in Chennai for the last six months apart from Ananya of course but thats a different category of affection. We walked towards the auto stand. Ananya greeted my mother but it went unnoticed. You are my mother asked me the most important question. I nodded. What did they serve I noticed she was ignoring Ananya completely. Paneer masala and rice I said. Mom youve met Ananya remember My mother gave Ananya a fake smile and turned back to me. No rotis Mom Ananya has a oneweek stint in her Delhi office. Where will she stay my mother said her voice concerned. At the company Guesthouse Ananya said. Yes but she only joins them day after on Monday. I thought it will be a good idea if she came home for the weekend. Whose home my mother asked aghast. Our home I said. I removed my bags from the trolley at the auto stand. My mother turned silent. I paid the money at the prepaid stand. DX www.desibbrg.com We fit ourselves and our bags into the auto. I sat in the middle with Ananya on my right and my mother on the left. All set for Mintis wedding I said. What a boy Minti is going to marry my mother said. Really Is he good I said. Oh yes so goodlooking. White as milk my mother said and guess the budget of the wedding I shrugged. Rajji mama is spending five lakh on the parties alone. Plus they have a big surprise gift for the boy for the sagan. Whats the boys name I said. Ananya didnt participate in the conversation. She turned her face to the scenery outside. Her hair blew in the breeze and a few strands caressed my face. I forget his real name but everybody calls him Duke. Duke Like British royalty duke I said. Yes he is an engineer from a donation college. Now he works in Escorts Software. And his parents are so nice my mother said. Every occasion they have met your mamaji they bring something for me. Theyve already given me three saris. Amazing I said. You should see how they give respect. The boy touches my feet every time he meets me. I nodded. I wanted to end the topic. But my mother was in full form. I asked Rajji mama why he is spending so much. You know what he said What He said didi where do you get good boys these days So I said if Duke is getting this what will Krish get I kept quiet. My mother continued anyway. He said if Dukes budget is five lakhs yours should be ten lakhs gifts separate. DX www.desibbrg.com Thanks for pricing me I said. I am just saying. My mother said. We remained silent for the next five minutes. My mother shifted in her seat due to lack of space. You could have booked a car. I would have paid I said. I didnt know youll bring extra luggage from Chennai my mother said. I showed Ananya the guestroom. She kept quiet as she took out fresh clothes to take into the bathroom. Hey Im sorry about my mother. Shes all talk. Good at heart. Even murderers are good at heart. I thought you had told her about my coming. I wanted to give her a surprise I said. Fuck off Ananya said as she pushed me out of the room. My father had gone for a business meeting. Ever since he left the army he had tried different ventures. These included a property dealership a security agency and a freight forwarding agency. None of them worked. According to him unscrupulous partners or corrupt officials had led to their failure. According to me it was his short temper and inability to come out of his army officer mode. When you are used to a hundred people saluting you every day it is difficult to suck up to uneducated builders to allow you to sell their house. However my father kept jumping from one disaster to the next which kept him out of the house most of the times. Some even said he had a mistress somewhere though I doubt another woman could survive him. Ananya hadnt left her room ever since she came. My mother went for her evening stroll at p.m. What are you doing inside Come out moms gone for a walk. She opened the door her face still upset. DX www.desibbrg.com Should we make love I winked at her. Dont test your luck Mr Malhotra I shall turn violent. She pushed me aside and came to the living room. She switched on the TV. Whats with this attitude Ananya You are supposed to win my folks over I said. You can win over normal people. Not rude insensitive people who insult guests she said. So you will stay inside that room and sulk I switched the TV off. I dont know what to do she said. If you listen to me you will be able to navigate her. I am all ears she said dryly. Dinner I said. Dinner what Do you guys talk anything but food What was that She asked what they served us on the plane Like the first thing when you landed. I opened the fridge and took out two Frootis. I gave her one. She is going to come back from her walk and prepare dinner. Offer to help her it is a good start. Help her She poked a straw into the Frooti with more force than necessary. You know make a dish or two. Or if you want to bowl her over make the dinner tonight. What Are you crazy Ive never made full dinner. Really I slurped noisily at my drink. Dont really me. Did you ever learn to cook No but I studied all the time. I went to IIMA too. Yeah but I said and paused. Yeah but what I am a girl so tough luck baby. Theres the kitchen she said and tossed the Frooti carton on the table. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya I am suggesting ways to win over my mother. You said you will do whatever it takes. Fine can I have another Frooti I am famished. I gave Ananya another tetrapack. The doorbell rang. Ananya stood up too go to her room. Stay I said as I opened the door. DX www.desibbrg.com My mother came back with two plastic bags full of vegetables. I helped her carry them into the kitchen. She opened the fridge to keep the vegetables inside. Who had the Frootis my mother said. I had one. And Ananya also. Three Frootis are missing. She had two she said. I kept quiet. We came to the living room. My mother brought a giant cauliflower a plate and a knife with her. She started cutting little florets with the knife using her thumb as a base. Aunty can I help Ananya said. With my mother said. With dinner Ananya said. Yeah mom why dont you let Ananya make dinner today I suggested with a heavy smile. Ananya glared at me. To help is one thing to prepare a whole meal another. Still if Ananya had to make an impression she had to more than wash the vegetables. My mother looked at Ananya. Sure aunty why not It will be fun Ananya said. Mom shrugged and passed the plate to Ananya. Krish likes gobi aloo. I thought we will also make black daal bhindi raita and salad. Nothing much simple dinner. Mom I said to stop her from increasing the menu. The dry atta is in the drum below the gas stove. Knead some for the rotis my mother said. Yes Krish Nothing. You want to cook together so it is faster I said. DX www.desibbrg.com She can make it if she wants to. I am not that hungry. Let it take time my mother said and switched on the TV. Ananya cradled the cauliflower in her lap like a newborn child. She couldnt cut it like a pro with the knife and thumb action. She cut florets one at a time using the knife like a saw. My mother sniggered. I gave her a dirty look. I have a headache. Ill rest in my room. Call me when dinner is ready my mother said and left. Ananya you want help I said. Leave me alone Ananya said her gaze deep into the cauliflower. Use your thumb like this I said and mocked the action with my hand. Ananya tried. Two florets later she cut herself. Ouch she screamed. What happened Nothing she sniffed. Nothing go rest with your mother. Is that blood I said. You are hurt Its OK. I said I will do what it takes. Whats a little blood This cut is not my mothers fault I said. Shut up and get me a bandaid. And bring the bhindi from the fridge she said. An hour later we had cut the gobi bhindi onions garlic ginger tomatoes cucumber and green chillies required for the various dishes. Until you do it yourself you dont realise the effort your mother puts into every meal. We went to the kitchen. I took out the atta in a bowl. I have no clue how to knead this she said. Its OK Ive seen my mother do it. Let me try I said and poured water into the bowl. And you fry the onions in this Ananya pulled out a kadhai from the utensil shelf. Yes please I said and switched on the gas. I opened the box of spices. She didnt know how to use them. DX www.desibbrg.com Remember the five constant spices in every Punjabi dish salt turmeric red chillies coriander powder and garam masala I said. Ananya cooked the vegetables while I worked the atta. I had to refill the atta twice due to too much stickiness. A pungent smoke rose in the kitchen. Both of us had a coughing fit. What did you do I said. I dont know. Ananya coughed uncontrollably. My mother came into the kitchen. What are you doing she ran to the stove and lowered the flame. Who cooks on such a high flame See the spices have burnt. Ananya backed off from the stove. And you What are you doing here my mother said. I I came here because of the burning smell I said. And you hands fell into the atta she said pointing to my doughsmeared palms and fingers. I kept quiet. See this is how she will use you after marriage. She cant even make rotis. Ananya exited the kitchen. I wanted to go after her but with mom present it didnt seem like a good idea. I threw up my attafilled hands in despair. She is South Indian mom how can you expect her to. You said she wants to make dinner. PK tell her to make dosas if she wants. Can she make dosas Yeah I am sure. But you need a grinder. Ananya came back into the kitchen. No aunty I cant make dosas Ananya said. And I cant make a roti either. In fact I am terrible at cooking anything. Apart from cooking schemes to trap my boy my mother said. They exchanged battlefield looks Ananya left the kitchen in disgust. Mom I said in frustration. DX www.desibbrg.com What What else is this my mother said. You are under her spell. You bring her home. You knead atta for her. You give her two Frootis I had brought for guests. You are so worried about her. What about me What about you mom What is she doing here Mom she can hear you. See you only care about her. Go be with her. My mother rearranged the plates in the kitchen. She threw the old spice mixture and made a new one as I left. Get me to the guesthouse. I want to leave Ananya said her face wet with tears. No I said and wiped her tears. No you cant. I cant do this she said. I thought convincing my parents would be enough. You said your mother is sweet. Sweet If your mom is sweet then Hitler is a cuddly toy. Take a shower Ananya I said. Lets all eat dinner together. We sat down for dinner. My mother served me. Ananya took the food herself. I chose the topic. What are the important ceremonies for Mintis wedding I have to go every day my mother said chewing her food. There is a puja then a sangeet. Of course the important ones are the sagan and the marriage next Friday and Sunday. Youll come no Sagan and marriage of course. Ill bring Ananya too. My mother gave me a dirty look. She didnt want to talk about it with Ananya present. Dont avoid the topic mom. Ive brought Ananya here so you and the family get to know her. I already know she cant cook dinner my mother said. Im sorry aunty Ananya said. I didnt expect it but felt relieved that Ananya apologised. DX www.desibbrg.com Its fine you modern girls are like this. That is why I want Krish to marry. Mom I want to marry Ananya I said in case it is not clear. My mother placed the piece of roti back on her plate and pushed the chair back to get up. Mom please wait. I want to talk I said. Why should I talk You will do whatever you want anyway. Go to the temple right now and get married. Aunty we want you to be happy about it Ananya said. Well I am not. You cant force me to be happy. Everyone is praising Mintis mother for her choice. Ive suffered for years to bring my son up. Why cant I have the same happiness I want a lavish wedding I want the girls parents to respect me I want the girl to be approved of by my brothers and sisters. They will like Ananya She is intelligent educated. She is South Indian my mother said cutting me. So what Lets see what your brothers and sisters say about Ananya. This wedding is a perfect excuse. And who will I say she is my mother asked grimly. Say she is Krishs classmate whos never seen a Punjabi marriage ceremony and wanted to come I said. My mother kept quiet. She picked up her roti and began to eat again. Aunty I am sorry I came unannounced. I thought Krish had told you. He never tells me anything. He is so careless my mother said. I agree he doesnt communicate well Ananya said. See my mother said to me. Even though they were ganging up against me I let it pass. I wanted them to bond in any way possible. The daal is excellent aunty you must teach me how to make it Ananya said. DX www.desibbrg.com Then why are you eating like a squirrel Take a proper helping my mother said. Ill speak to Minti I put in. Im sure she will have no problem if I bring a friend. Only as a friend my mother said. Thanks mom I said and hugged her. Your dad never gave me anything. You dont deprive me of what I deserve my mother said. Wheres uncle Ananya said. Who knows my mother said. Hell be back late. Youll see him in the morning. You are sleeping in the guestroom and Krish in his room right Of course mom I said how else My mother finished dinner. Ananya offered to do the dishes. My mother said the maid would arrive in the morning but Ananya insisted. My mother went to her room. OK Miss Brand Manager you sure you dont need help I said as I leaned against the kitchen wall. Ananya applied Vim on the dishes with a wire mesh. No I dont want to be accused of trapping the Prince of Punjab again Ananya said and mercilessly scrubbed a kadhai. Let me dry the dishes I offered. Go away I beg you she said as she pushed me out of the kitchen. DX www.desibbrg.com Good morning uncle Ananya said as she came into the living room in her nightsuit. It was seventhirty in the morning. My father bound to his army habit had showered and changed. He looked up from his newspaper. He didnt respond. Im Ananya Krishs friend. Good my father said and went back to his newspaper. He kept calm. I knew hed blow his lid when Ananya left. I came to the living room and ignored him. Ananya get ready. We should leave before the peakhour traffic. Where are you going my father said. I didnt answer. My father stood up and went to the kitchen. Is this the way to behave I heard him scream at my mother. What happened my mother said as I kept one ear to the kitchen. I asked him where is he going he didnt answer. And who is that girl He is going to drop Ananya to her guesthouse and go to office. Why my mother said. Why cant he say it And why didnt you tell me we will have a visitor in the house. I didnt know my mother said. You are lying again my father screamed. Ananya looked terrified. Welcome to my world I said now lets get the hell out of here. I came home from work and found deadly silence in the house. Obviously my father was home. He sat at the dining table with my mother. DX www.desibbrg.com Krish your father wants to talk to you my mother said. Tell him I dont want to I said. He said he wont come for Mintis wedding if you dont speak to him my mother said. Weddings on my mothers side of the family were when we needed my father the most. My mother wanted to portray a sense of normalcy. If my father showed his face it prevented tongues wagging for weeks. I had no choice. I went and sat opposite him. So now that you have resorted to blackmail what do you want to talk about I said. Its not blackmail. When my family doesnt talk to me why should I. he said. Whatever. What is it I said. Who is that girl Ananya Swaminathan How do you know her She is a classmate from college and my girlfriend. See Kavita my father said and you said she is only a friend. You talk to me why do you have to take it out on her I said. What is the purpose of her visit here my father said. She came on a work assignment. Minti invited her to the wedding. Do you have a problem You will not choose a girl for marriage. I will choose for you my father said. You want to sell me. And while you are out there negotiating me whats my going rate Kavita this boy. This boy is right here. Talk to me. I am not coming for Mintis wedding my father announced. Please dont do that.

I dare you I said and stood up. I went to my room but could hear them. I wont come for the wedding Kavita my father said. The sound of a clattering plate presumably shoved away on the dining table. Do whatever you want all of you my mother said. I lay in bed I wondered why we even stayed together as a family. I never thought I would but I missed Chennai. Sure people there didnt really connect with me but at least nobody could jab my insides. I thought of calling Ananya but I didnt want to dump my mood on her. Questions darted in my mind. Am I even doing the right thing by bringing Ananya into this family What impression will she have of me Will she change her mind about me Watching my minds stupid daily presleep thought dance I tossed and turned in bed all night. DX www.desibbrg.com Mintis wedding ceremony took place at the Taj Palace Hotel in Dhaula Kuan. Frankly it was a big deal for our clan. We had seen some over the top weddings but never before did an engagement ceremony happen at a top end fivestar hotel. Rajji mama had taken his oneupmanship among the relatives right to the top by booking the Taj. The banquet hall entrance had a sign. The Talrejas welcome you To SAGAN ceremony of their Most lovely daughter Manorama Minti With Dashing Gentleman Dharamveer Duke B. Tech Dont laugh I said to Ananya suppressing my own smile. I cant help it she grinned. She adjusted the drape of her bottle green and gold sari for the fifth time. Welcomeji welcome Rajji mama gave my mother and me hugs in quick succession. We came inside the banquet hall which held two hundred people. The main stage had two ornate chairs stolen from a kings palace. Alongside there were seventyfive boxes of sweets and five giant baskets of fruits. Most of the women stood at t he chaat and juice counter. All the men stood at the bar. I helped my female cousins access vodka by giving them my glass which they poured into their juice. So there is Rajji mama Lappa mama Shipra masi and your mother in that order right Ananya said. DX www.desibbrg.com Yes and since my mother is the youngest she needs validation from all of them to do anything in life I said. Fine let me understand first. Minti and Rohan are Rajji mamas children Ananya said and took out a notepad. And who is the girl you gave the vodka to Thats Tinki and she has a younger sister Nikki both in college. They are Lappa mamas children. And Shipra masi has a son and a daughter Bittu and Kittu. Thats it my mom only has me. OK OK Ananya said as she finished taking notes. Krish come here my mother screamed. She stood next to the stage. Lets go I said and pulled Ananyas hand. Ananya hesitated at first but came along. My mother sat with an eightyyearold lady who wore a gold necklace. It had a pendant bigger than the Olympic gold medal. She is Swaran aunty my masi my mother said. My grandmother had died a couple of years ago. Swaran aunty was the seniormost family member who was brought out at weddings and other auspicious occasions to bless everyone. I bent forward to touch her feet. I signaled and Ananya followed. Kavita teri noo hai Swaran aunty said in Punjabi asking if Ananya was my mothers daughterinlaw. My mother explained she was a friend. What is friend Swaran aunty asked me. Aunty you need chaat I countered. Yes nobody is getting me anything she complained. I returned with a plate of chaat. Ananya sat next to Swaran aunty and my mother. She is Madrasi Swaran aunty said in a voice loud enough to belie her age. Tamilian Ananya said. DX www.desibbrg.com But she is fair complexioned Swaran aunty said genuinely confused. For her years her eyesight wasnt bad at all. Shipra masi passed by looking expensive. Everything she wore clothes jewellery handbag and shoes contained real gold of varying proportions. Shipra see this a gori Madrasin Swaran aunty screamed. Hello Kavita how are you Krish Fine aunty meet my friend Ananya Oh we all know what kind of friend. Yes she is fair. Shipra masi called for Rajji mama and Lappa mamas wives Kamla and Rajni respectively. Come see Krishs friend. The Madrasin Kavita told us about Shipra masi shrieked. Rajni aunty and Kamla aunty came over. We exchanged polite greetings. My mother explained how my father had viral fever so he couldnt come. Everyone knew the truth but nodded in total support. Shipra masi even suggested some medicines. Ananya Swaminathan aunty Ananya repeated her name to Kamla mami as she hadnt caught it the first time. You are so fair. Are you hundred percent South Indian Kamla mami asked. She is also an IIMA pass out and a brand manager at HLL I wanted to say. But those are things you discuss in Chennai not at the Taj Palace Delhi during the Talrejas sagan ceremony. By South Indian standards she is quite pretty Shipra masi added insight. I know otherwise how black and ugly they are Kamla mami said. Everyone laughed apart from Ananya. She had braved a smile all along but it disappeared. I moved next to her and gently patted her back. I didnt want her to react. Smile like a ditz and your chances of being accepted will improve. Sometimes love is tested in strange ways. The boys side has come Kittu my youngest cousin came running inside like Amitabh Bachchan had lost his way and rung the doorbell. DX www.desibbrg.com Lets go lets go Kamla mami hauled up all the ladies. The ladies deposited their gold sequined bags with Swaran aunty. Her immobility made her an ideal cloakroom. So what is the surprise gift my mother egged on Kamla aunty. You will see it soonji. But the expense has broken our back. Mintis daddy had to take a loan. Its OK you have only one daughter Shipra masi said as all of them walked out. Ananya let out a huge sigh after the Punjabi aunty gang left. You OK I said. No let me guess. You are not OK. I need a drink lets go to the bar Ananya said. But stay a few steps away. Ill order the drink I said. We reached the bar. Tinki and Nikki came running to me their lehngas lifted up to their ankles with their hands. Krish bhaiya get a full glass of neat vodka. My friends from college have come. Why cant the girls take drinks themselves Ananya asked. Tinki and Nikki turned to Ananya puzzled. At nineteen and seventeen they looked overdressed in their designer clothes. Tinki Nikki this is Ananya I said. Oh you are the one Tinki exclaimed. The one who I said. She is your girlfriend no Krish bhaiya Nikki said. I didnt respond. You are blushing Tinki said and turned to Ananya. I love your earrings. Where did you get them from Coimbatore Ananya said. Where is that Tinki said. DX www.desibbrg.com Tamil Nadu that is where I come from Ananya said. Stupid didnt you read it in geography Nikki scolded her sister and turned to me Your girlfriend is so pretty. And her sari is also so beautiful. Thanks Ananya said. Both of you look great. I want a lehnga like that. I took a full glass of vodka from the bar and poured it into three glasses. I topped the drinks with Sprite and brought it for the girls. I dont drink. Its only for the DJ later Tinki clarified. Anyway I am eighteen now. You went to IIMA no You must be so intelligent. Can girls get into IIM Nikki said. Of course why not Whats it got to do with being a girl Ananya said. I stepped away from them. The girls talked for the next ten minutes. If nothing else Ananya had bonded with the younger set of my family. Why was it so much harder to win over the older generation Where are you my mothers angry voice cut into my musings. The ceremony is about to start. I collected the girls and we went to the stage. Minti sat on the floor of the stage with Duke in front of her. A priest sat alongside. As my aunts would say Duke was on the healthier side. He is fat Ananya said flatly. Shut up someone will hear you I said. Oh people really are careful about what they say around here Ananya said sarcasm shimmering in her words like the sequins in her blouse. Cmon Ananya they are not even aware they are being offensive. You will like them once you know them. Please I like your cousins let me be with them Ananya said her voice defiant from the vodka. We like her Nikki and Tinki certified as they gave Ananya a hug. Just like men women too become friendlier after alcohol. DX www.desibbrg.com Duke was indeed fair as milk. The chubby cheeks and fair complexion made him look like a solely Cerelacfed adult. He wore a shiny maroon kurta of probably the same fabric as one of Ananyas moms saris. Damn I was remembering Ananyas mother here. Focus I said to myself. Minti wore an orange lehnga studded with Swarovski crystals and other precious stones. According to my mother it cost twenty thousand rupees while the wedding sari had cost thirty thousand. Ten percent of the wedding budget is bridal costumes my brain made a useless calculation. The priest chanted mantras. Minti gestured at her cousins to ask if she looked fine. Nikki put her right thumb tip and index finger tip together to signify she looked fab. Nikki also put her right middle finger on her forehead to show Minti she needed to adjust her bindi. Minti followed the instructions and fixed her bindi with the left hand even as the priest tied a thread on her right. I learnt three facts about women a they never lose track of how they look b they help each other out by giving instructions in any way possible and c they can multitask. Of course my mind couldnt focus on the ceremony. I thought of ways to make my family like Ananya. Duke pulled out an engagement ring from his kurta pocket. He displayed it for the cameras. A collective sigh ran across the women as they realised it was a solitaire. Oneandahalfcarats at least Shipra masi curated it immediately. Duke put the ring on Mintis finger and everyone clapped. Minti gave a shy smile as she brought out a ring a simple gold band for Duke. She put the ring on him. She looks so sweet Tinki said and the two sisters gave each other hugs their eyes wet. Women have surplus emotions and they dont need a big trigger to spill them out. Dukes family waited after the ring ceremony in anticipation. Rajji mama took out a little box from his shirt pocket. He passed it on to Duke. Duke refused three times. Rajji mama insisted until Duke accepted it. Duke opened the black box. It had a key with the Hyundai Motors sign on it. This time the women and men gave out a collective sigh. Yes Rajji mama had outdone the solitaire. DX www.desibbrg.com Theyve given a car Shipra masi said to make it clear in case somebody hadnt got it. Grownups from both sides opened their respective sweet boxes and forcefed the other family. All of us went on stage one by one and congratulated the couple. Mintis parents gave gifts to all of Dukes uncles and aunts. Dukes parents returned the favour. My mother and Shipra masi received a sari each. Show me yours Shipra masi said to my mother. Fortunately they found them similar. Dukes parents could not be accused of aunt favouitism. Rajji mama gloated after everyone complimented him on the masterstroke gift. Uncle start the DJ Nikki said to Rajji mama. Rajji mama nodded towards the dance floor. DJ pussycats from Rajouri Garden comprised of two fat surds who had waited hours for that signal. They started with dhol beats. All the younger cousins hit the dance floor. The uncles needed a few more pegs and the aunties needed a few more elbow pulls from the younger kids to come and groove. They gave a car Ananya said in shocked voice even as Nikki dragged her towards the dance floor. Yeah a silver Santro Nikki said come no didi. Ananya went with the girls. Her years of Bharatnatyam training made her the best performer on the floor. She picked up the Punjabi steps fast and even taught my cousins a few improvised moves. She looked beautiful in her dark green Kanjeevaram . Like an idiot I fell in love with her all over again. Have you eaten dinner my mother came up next to me. Er no I said peeling my eyes away from the floor. Then eat fast we wont get an auto home my mother said. We will buy a car soon I said. Like your father will let us have one. Anyway why should we take Kamla said we shouldnt buy anything major until you get married. We dont want duplicate items. Mom I protested. DX www.desibbrg.com Go fast the paneer will get over. And tell your friend to eat. I waved at Ananya to come eat with me. She panted as she walked with me to the buffet. I put black daal shahi paneer and rotis on my plate. Ananya took yellow daal and rice. Thats it Thats all I like she said. There was a commotion at the bar. Duke and his friends were fighting with the bartender. What happened I asked. They are not making the pegs large enough. Dukes friends are upset an onlooker said. Rajji mama intervened. The hotel staff had foreseen that the whisky may run out and so had started doling out smaller quantities. There were no extra bottles of that brand even in the hotel. Rajji mama took out a wad of notes and gave it to the hotel staff. A waiter was sent to the Delhi border to fetch the whisky. Like always money soothed nerves and everyone became cheerful again. This is a wedding Ananya said. Of course thats how all weddings are. Why your side has it different I said. You bet Ananya said. We bade goodbyes to Rajji mama and Kamla aunty. As I walked out with my mother and Ananya Shipra masi called me. Yes aunty I said. Listen you are our familys pride. Dont do anything stupid. These Madrasis have laid a trap for you. Good night aunty I said. See I am saying it for your benefit. Your mother has suffered make her happy. You can get girls who will fill your house with gifts. I bent down. If all else fails with kin touch feet. What did Shipra masi say Ananya asked me. DX www.desibbrg.com She said to make sure Ananya is dropped home safe I said as I stopped an auto. DX www.desibbrg.com I met Ananya at Punjabi by Nature in Vasant Vihar. I should have thought of a betternamed venue given her current mental state. However the location was convenient and the food excellent. What is the point of me attending these family events I feel so awkward Ananya began. Its one more ceremony the actual wedding. Dont worry tomorrow my aunts will be more used to you. Once my mother sees them accepting you she is more likely to say yes. I think she wants a set of car keys more than anyones approval Ananya said. No my mother is not like that. She doesnt want the car but she wants her siblings to appreciate she managed a car. Get it Not really Ananya shook her head. The waiter came to take the order. We ordered one paranthas which came with enough butter to stop your heart instantly. We ate dinner as we contemplated our next move. Sir would you like to try our golgappas with vodka the waiter said. What Ananya said. No thanks I told the waiter and turned to Ananya. It is a gimmick. Trust me Punjabis dont do that on a regular basis. I am going back to Chennai in two days Ananya said. I know. But I will speak to mom maybe even my uncles after the wedding. I want to lock this in I said. What about your dad Ananya said. He wont agree. Well have the wedding without him. Arent moms side relatives enough They are more than enough. Each talks more than ten of my relatives. Still. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananya you cant get everything in life. Your parents my mom relatives we have enough blessings. My father is not required. You should talk to him though. Hes your father Ananya said. Isnt the food great I said as I rubbed butter on my paranthas. DX www.desibbrg.com Mintis final wedding ceremony gave new meaning to the expression over the top. Real elephants and ice sculpture fairies greeted us at the entrance. The boys side had not yet arrived. Patient ushers waited with trays of flower petals. We shuffled through landscaped gardens with two dozen dolphinshaped fountains to reach the main party area. The caterer had chosen a world theme. Food stalls served eight cuisines Punjabi Chinese homestyle Indian Thai Italian Mexican Goan and Lebanese with at least five items in each genre. Apart from these there were two chaat stalls one for regular eaters and other for healthconscious guests. The regular counter served samosas and tikkis while the health counter had sproutsstuffed golgappas. My aunts took both one for the taste another for health. There were two bars. The first bar had a giant Johnny Walker Black Label magnum cask. All uncles congregated here and waiters kept bringing in a regular supply of paneer tikkas and hara bhara kababs. The second bar was the mocktail bar nicknamed the ladies bar. It had a large display shelf with two dozen glasses of different shapes and filled with psychedelic fruit drinks. Beautiful Rajji you have held the family name high my mother said admiring the flower arrangements on the bridal stage. These orchids have come from Thailand. Just landed two hours ago from Bangkok Rajji mama said. Fifty thousand is just the flowers bill Shipra masi said. We raised our eyebrows to express suitable awe. My cousin Rohan came running in to tell us that the baraat had arrived. We went outside and stood next to the elephants to receive them. Rohan gave me a pink turban something all brothers and close male relatives wore to receive the groom. You look cute Ananya grinned. All turbaned men posed for pictures with their equivalent counterparts from Dukes side. I had a picture clicked with Prince Dukes cousin. Mintis father grinned as he hugged Dukes father for a picture. Dukes father frowned. Why is the boys father so serious Ananya said. Maybe he is hungry I said. We soon found out I was wrong. Dukes family did come inside and sat on the sofas. However they refused to touch anything to eat. DX www.desibbrg.com One cold drinkji Kamla mami begged Dukes mother who shook her head. We are not hungry Dukes father said. Duke his parents and a dozen close relatives sat on the sofas next to the stage. Half a dozen waiters stood by with trays but the boys side ate nothing. The snacks are not hot go get fresh ones Mintis father screamed at the waiters. His anger was misplaced. The boys family had not refused food because of its temperature. Ask whats the matter. Something is wrong Shipra masi said. Who will ask Rajji mama said. They are not saying anything. Kamla aunty wore a worried expression. Ten minutes passed. Whats going on Ananya said. I shrugged. Shipra masi told the younger cousins to move back. She folded her hands and went to Dukes father. He looked the other way. Ananya and I stepped back a few metres. We could see the elders but not hear them. My mother and her two brothers folded their hands in front of Dukes parents. Like a landless farmer they waited for the feudal lords to respond. A few minutes later one of Dukes aunts spoke to my mother. My mother nodded as she listened carefully. After Dukes aunt finished my mother came back to huddle with her siblings. This is too much drama. I have to know whats going on Ananya said. I pulled my mother aside. Its the Santro my mother said. What It doesnt start Be serious Krish. Sorry what happened Some misunderstanding has occurred. When Rajji gave the Hyundai keys Dukes parents thought it was Hyundai Accent. But it was a Hyundai Santro. Accent costs five lakh Santro only three lakh. DX www.desibbrg.com I thought it was a gift Ananya said. If my mother found Ananyas entry into the family conversation odd she was too preoccupied to dwell on it. Yeah wasnt it a surprise I said. What do you think this is Krish A birthday party Everyone knows the surprise. Dukes parents had already announced the Accent to their family. They are feeling insulted and cheated. It is amazing how people can feel insulted even after being welcomed by elephants. Now what I said. Nothing they are saying no wedding until Rajji changes the car. Can he I said. He is already broke doing this wedding. But what choice does he have He has promised them he will. Then why are they sitting there with sullen faces I said. They want a guarantee. Dukes father wants the difference in cash right now. Now I said. Ananyas eyebrows went up and stayed there as she didnt know how to react. Shipra masi called my mother again and the elders held animated discussions. Is this for real I am so pissed off Ananya said. I am as stunned by it as you I said. We went to the ladies bar. I ordered two mocktail daiquiris. What are they discussing Why dont they call the police Ananya said. Ananya I said are you stupid I handed her a glass. No I want to send some criminals to jai. Is that stupid Yeah if you care about Mintis reputation. Plus what about all theyve spent I pointed to the various stalls. DX www.desibbrg.com Oh and nothing about the little fact that your sister is going to marry into a family of total jerks. This kind of stuff happens. The elders will resolve it I said. We should be with the family at this time Ananya said as she kept her glass down. We moved back to Drama Venue. Rajji mama had placed his pink turban at Dukes parents feet. They ignored him. He offered a cheque Dukes parents refused it. Rajji mama called his friends for cash. No one could come up with such a large amount at such a short notice. Meanwhile new guests were arriving at the party. With them Rajji mama his his stress and smiled and hugged all of them. Meanwhile the ladies came up with a bizarre plan. Quick Kavita take your jewellery off Shipra masi said and removed her own necklace. My mother struggled to remove her bangles. Kamla and Rajni mami took off their jewellery sets as well. Shipra masi put all the ornaments in a plastic bag and gave it to Rajji mama. Give this to them. Tell them to keep it until the car is replaced she said. Rajji mama fell on Shipra masis feet. Are you mad You are my little brother. Minti is our daughter Shipra masi said. All her siblings broke into tears. Dukes father still sofabound kept looking at us from the corner of his eye. Now go Shipra masi said. Ill check with them first Rajji mama said. He went up to Dukes father. I cant believe this Ananya said. Shsh everything will be normal soon I said. Rajji mama returned after meeting Dukes parents. Shipra didi theyve agreed to keep the extra jewellery as security Rajji mama said. Rajji mama collected the bag from Shipra masi. Uncle wait Ananya said. All eyes turned to her. This isnt your business I wanted to tell Ananya. DX www.desibbrg.com May I suggest something Ananya said before you give it to them Rajji mama. What my mother said to Ananya surprised. Aunty you elders have had so many meetings to resolve this. Can the younger cousins talk to Duke Ananya said. Ananya this matter concerns grownups I said. Its Dukes marriage. We should have a word with him Ananya said. When the jewellery is ready then why Kamla mami said. Please uncle Shipra masi please. Whats the harm Ananya said. Shipra masi sighed her consent. Tinki Nikki Rohan Kittu Bittu and us sat in a separate group of chairs ten metres away from the grownups. Ananya walked up to Dukes side of the family and identified a twentyyearold boy. Are you Dukes cousin Yes myself Pranjal he said. Good can you collect all Dukes cousins and bring them to Mintis cousins over there Ananya said pointing to our group. Whats going on Dukes father said. Uncle the younger people want to have a meeting. Cmon Pranjal round them up fast Ananya said. Who is this girl Dukes mother said. Im their family friend Ananya said and turned to the groom Duke can you join us Duke gave Ananya a puzzled look. Ananya continued to stare at Duke until he became uncomfortable and stood up. She asked him to follow her. Krish call Minti here Ananya said. Minti I squeaked. Ill get her Tinki said and ran inside. DX www.desibbrg.com We made a circle of a dozen younger cousins along with Minti and Duke. The elders gave us a suspicious looks from far keen to know what was going on but Ananya made sure all younger cousins had their backs to the elders. We shouldnt have allowed this Dukes mother said. Of courseji two minutesji Rajji mama said agreeing to everything Dukes parents said. Hello everyone Ananya stood up to address the cousins. I sat next to her. Everyone returned a meek hi in response. Do you think what is happening here is right Ananya said. Duke and his cousins looked down avoiding eye contact. My cousins huddled next to Minti trying to keep her calm. Rajji mama and Kamla mami gave helpless looks to Dikes parents as all of them wanted to peek into Ananyas conference. Shipra masi walked over to the younger set. What are you doing Shipra masi said to Ananya Mintis life will be ruined if they leave. I think her life would be ruined if they stay. Aunty please give us some privacy. You make sure Dukes parents stay put Ananya said. As Shipra masi left Ananya turned to Duke Yes you. Stand up if you can. Duke stood up. He was six inches taller than Ananya and twice her weight. Of course these anatomical facts didnt register with my mad girlfriend. What do you do Duke Ananya asked. I am a software engineer he said. How much do you make Ananya said. Duke kept quiet. Tell me Ananya said in a loud voice. DX www.desibbrg.com Ten thousand a month he said in a heavy Punjabi accent. Great I make twentyfive thousand. Still can you tell me what have you done to deserve a wedding like this What have you done to deserve a car to be gifted to you I I am the b boys side Duke stammered. So Have you seen Minti Ananya said. Duke nodded. You are having an arranged marriage. That is why you are getting a girl like her. If you had to woo her can you even in your dreams have a girlfriend like her Duke kept quiet as he shifted his largeness from one leg to the other. What Ananya said. This is too much Duke said. I am too much Ananya agreed and gave Duke a Bharatnatyamstyle glare. She spoke again. Do you know what Mintis parents had to go through to do this wedding for you That car cost two and half years of your salary Mr Duke These two parties have thrown him into debt. Now you want an Accent It wont be your Accent it will be what you managed to wrench out of a helpless father who didnt want a drama at his daughters wedding to turn into a scandal. It was too many words for Duke to process at one go. He was stunned like the rest of the cousins more by Ananyas confidence and fluent English than what she was saying. Sit down Ananya said. Duke complied instantly. Ananya turned to everyone. Listen all brothers and sisters of Duke there isnt going to be any Accent. The elders have shown their true colours now it is down to Duke and all of you. If he wants to take Minti with respect he should say so. If he doesnt then he is just a schmuck and we dont want the wedding. Ananya beta. Rajji mama came to us as the youngsters meeting had gone for too long. Almost done uncle Ananya said. Five minutes Duke. Make up your mind. DX www.desibbrg.com Everyone fell silent as Ananya Swaminathan brand manager HLL MBA rated best girl by popular vote at IIMA and rated best girlfriend by my own vote forced the younger generation in Dukes family to think. DX www.desibbrg.com The cousins fell silent as seconds ticked past. Duke wanted to say something but he noticed his parents sour faces from far and kept quiet. He huddled with his own cousins as they exchanged whispers with each other. He stood up again and spoke to Ananya after four minutes. Excuse me madam Duke said. Im Ananya. What Can we go to the grownups I want to talk to my mother. About what Ananya said and blocked him. Why are you so dominating Let me go. Lets all go Ananya said. All the cousins stood up from their chairs. We walked up to the grownups. Duke went to his mother. Mummy I want to marry Minti. Dukes mother gave her son a shocked look. But they have betrayed us beta Dukes father said. Rajji mama dived towards their feet again. Ananya stopped him. Daddy I have kept quiet for so long no everything you have decided. Now whatever it is dont spoil my marriage. Beta but hey promised us Dukes mother said. Mummy enough And why this drama of keeping their jewellery What do you think I cant buy my own car Five minutes are over Ananya said should we pack up or. What kind of a girl are you You are not even giving me time to convince Duke said to Ananya. One of Dukes uncles stood up. Lets startji. We cant spoil our childrens happy day. We are already late for the jaimala ceremony. DX www.desibbrg.com Are they OK Rajji mama said looking at Dukes parents. Dont worry misunderstandings happen. We dont have to spoil a lifelong relationship Dukes uncle said as he signaled for all others to stand up. Everyone please enjoy the snacks Duke said. It was enough cue for his relatives to jump at the waiters. It is cruel to keep Punjabis away from their food at a wedding especially when most of them had no stake in the car anyway. Our side of the family hugged Dukes parents. They didnt hug back but at least they didnt push us away. Rajji mama brought a box of mithai and fed Dukes parents a piece each in their mouths. The sugar rush improved their expression. The DJ started the music. The wedding was back on. One girl stood back until everyone vacated their sofas and went to the stage. It was the South Indian girl who had come with me all the way form Chennai. What did she say to him Shipra masi asked me. She took her bag back and redistributed the ornaments. I shrugged my shoulders. Very wise girl Kamla aunty gave Ananya a hug. Thank you beta. You kept our izzat. But tell me one thing you earn twentyfive thousand Rajni aunty asked the question everyone wanted to ask. My mother came and gave Ananya a smiling nod. Even though my mother didnt say anything I knew it meant a lot. Shes not that bad Shipra masi told my mother during jaimala. Youve scored girl you know you have I said to Ananya as we tossed flower petals on Duke and Minti. DX www.desibbrg.com So mom I said as I was saying. We were in the kitchen. Youve said that four times. Do you actually have something to say my mother said. She removed boiling tea from the stove. Ananya leaves tomorrow I said. OK she said. She passed me a cup of tea. I called her home to meet us before she left. And my mother said. Wed like to know your decision I said. Its your decision she said. OK your opinion which is important for me and to make my decision. Uff you and your MBA terms my mother said. Ananya came home in the afternoon. My mother cut a melon as we sat at the dining table. So mom the unthinkable happened. Your relatives like Ananya. Now do I have your permission to marry her You dont need my permission my mother said passing me melon slices. Not permission approval. Do we have your approval I said. She gave a few slices of fruit to Ananya. Is that a yes I said. Kamla aunty and Rajji mama are quite fond of her my mother said. Do you like me aunty Tell me if you are not convinced Ananya said. Of course I do beta my mother said her hand on Ananyas head. But there are other people too your side of the family. My family likes Krish a lot DX www.desibbrg.com Yes but what about the families liking each other You two may be happy but we adults have to get along with the adults from your side. You remember Sabarmati Ashram Be patient mom. Over time the families will get close I said. Ananya brought up the topic of my father one last time before she left. Krishs dad wont agree Ananya said. My mother gave a wry smile. He wont let us watch TV forget Krish Choosing his bride. Its fine my siblings are enough. Otherwise it will never happen my mother said. Ananya nodded. My mother went to her room and returned with two gold bangles. No aunty Ananya said even as my mother shoved it down her wrists and kissed her head. Happiness floated like rose petals in the air and I imagined fist pumping my hand three times So whats the next step The wedding date Ananya and I were on our longdistance call from our respective offices. You know your mother is right there is a gap here Ananya said. What gap I said. My parents like you. Your mother likes me. What about them liking each other Remember the Ahmedabad disaster Ananya said. Yeah but I said. Oh man I thought we were done. No the two families have to unite. Trust me it will be worth is. We should make them meet I said. Where Ill come to Chennai with my mother I said. DX www.desibbrg.com No lets go to a neutral venue without relatives. Good point. Let me organise something I ended the call. I went back to work. I didnt have a fixed division or boss in Citibank Delhi yet. I floated between departments pretending to be useful. I had a temporary stint in the credit cards division. I had to come up with a credit card promotion plan something I had no interest or expertise in. I opened the existing brochure of offers for our credit card customers. We had a special deal on a package to Goa. I picked up the phone and called Ananya again. Goa I said. Lets all go to Goa. Nothing like the sea sun and sand to make the two families bond. Plus it will be fun for us too. What say next month It wont be cheap she said. Isnt love the best investment I said and fumbled through my cards to call the travel agent. DX www.desibbrg.com ACT Goa DX www.desibbrg.com I am telling you now only. I dont like her mother arrogant woman my mom said as we waited at the taxi stand. My mother and I landed at the Dabolim Airport in Goa two hours before Ananya and her parents did. I had tried to time the flights as close as possible. Its not arrogance. They are quiet people I said. Dont be under their spell my mother said. Im not. OK here they come remember to smile I said. Ananyas parents came face to face with my mother for the second time. Hello Kavitaji Ananyas father said. They exchanged greetings not warm and cuddly like Delhi airports but not completely icecold either. I had hired a Qualis. I helped the driver load Ananyas bags into the car. My mother gave me a puzzled look. What I said. She shook her head. I sat in front. Ananyas family took the middle seat. Oh Ill sit at the back my mother said. OK Ananyas mother said. I realised the faux pas. No mom I will take the backseat I said. My mother declined as she had already taken her place. Park Hyatt I said. The driver turned the car towards South Goa. My mother took out a plastic packet from her bag. Here for you my mother said and passes a sari to Ananyas mother. Ananyas mother turned around and took the packet. Thank you she said. Its tussar silk my mother said I bought it from the Assam emporium. DX www.desibbrg.com Silk is very popular in the South also we have Kanjeevaram saris Ananyas mother said and she kept the sari in her bag. We didnt speak much until we reached the resort. Hotel staff received us with a garland of flowers and a fruitpunch welcome drink. None of us had ever stayed in a fivestar hotel. Isnt this expensive my mother said. They gave me a deal. I promised Ill get Citibank to do their annual conference here I said. Welcome Mr Krish we have two garden view rooms booked for you the receptionist said. And I have some good news. One of the rooms we are offering an upgrade to a larger seaview room. Wow Ananya said Ive never stayed in a seaview room. Of course Ananya and I werent staying together. I was to share a room with my mother while Ananya would be with her parents. And since they were three of them I made the choice. Ananya your family can take the larger room. Mom and I will take the other one I said. The bellboys carried the luggage to our room. Nice place no I said to my mother as we passed a flower garden. My mother didnt respond. Everything OK I said. My mother gave a brief nod. She kept quiet until we had reached the room. They are very rude people my mother said. Who The hotel staff I said as I opened the curtains to see the garden view. Shut up these people you want to make your inlaws. Are they inlaws They are making their soninlaw pick up luggage Huh When I asked. At the airport. You dont even realise you have become their servant I. I said searching for a response I wanted to help. DX www.desibbrg.com Nonsense and why did they take the seaview room We are the boys side. They are more people. Besides do you care Isnt the garden pretty Whatever have you noticed their biggest blunder she said. What They didnt get anything. I gave their daughter two bangles. They should have some shame. In Punjabi terms Ananyas parents had committed a cognizable offence. You dont meet the boys side emptyhanded. Ever. And I gave her a silk sari for two thousand bucks. She didnt even appreciate it. She did. No she was bragging about her South saris my mother said. This is one of the huge downsides of getting married. A guy has to get involved in discussion about saris and gold. Mom we have come here to get to know them. Dont prejudge please. And now get ready for dinner. You will take their side only. You are trapped. She muttered. Stupid boy doesnt know his own value. DX www.desibbrg.com Few things bring out the differences between Punjabis and Tamilians than buffet meals. Tamilians see it like any other meal. They will load up on white rice first followed by daal and curds and anything that has little dots of mustard coconut or curry leaves. For Punjabis food triggers an emotional response like say music. And the array of dishes available in a buffet is akin to the Philharmonic orchestra. The idea is you load as many calories as possible onto one plate as most party caterers charged based on the number of plates used. Also like my mother explained since childhood never take a dish that is easily prepared at home or whose ingredients are cheap. So no yellow daal boring gobi aloo or green salad. The focus is on the chicken dishes with dry fruits in them and exotic desserts. You can take more than one plate here mom I said as she tossed three servings of butter chicken for me. Really No extra charge she said. We returned to our table. You are having rice my mother said as she saw the others plates. They nodded as they ate with spoons. Their fingers itched to feel the squishy texture of rice mixed with curd and daal. Ananya had made them curb their primal instincts to prevent shocking my mother. Chicken is too good. Did you try my mother said and lifted up a piece to offer them. We are vegetarian Ananyas mother said coldly even as the chicken leg hung midair. Oh mother said. Its OK aunty I will try it. Ananya said. We ate in much silence with only our chewing making a sound. Amma something something Ananya whispered in Tamil egging her on to talk. Your husband didnt come Ananyas mother said. DX www.desibbrg.com No he is not well. Doctor has told him not to travel by air my mother said. There is a train to Goa form Delhi Ananyas father supplied. Ananya gave her father a glance making him return to his food. We dont travel by train my mother said lying of course. I have no idea why. She continued Actually Punjabis are quite largehearted people. We like to live well. When we meet people we give them nice gifts. Mom do you want dessert There is mango icecream I said. She ignored me. Yeah we never meet anyone emptyhanded. Oh and meeting the boys side emptyhanded is unthinkable my mother said as I gently stamped her foot. OK Ive booked a car for sightseeing tomorrow. Please be in the coffee shop by seven I said. Illa sightseeing Ananyas mother mumbled. Sure well be there Ananya said. Ananya and I met for a walk postdinner at Park Hyatts private beach. My parents are upset Ananya said your mother should learn to talk. The waves splashed the shore as many tourist couples walked handinhand in front of us. I bet they werent discussing the mood swings of their future inlaws. Your parents should know how to behave I said. There we were at one of the most romantic locations in India having our first marital discord. In an Indian love marriage by the time everyone gets on board one wonders if there is any love left. How can they behave better she said. I will tell you. But you must do exactly as I said I said. If it is reasonable said my sensible girlfriend. Step one buy my mother an expensive gift. Really Yes step two when we go out in Goa tomorrow always offer to pay. DX www.desibbrg.com Everywhere Yes at restaurants to taxis or anywhere else. And when you offer she will say no. but insist if needed snatch her purse to prevent her from paying. In Punjabi this is considered OK even affectionate. Ananyas jaw went slack. Step three never let me do any work when everyones around. For example at the breakfast table tell your mother to bring toast for me. She snorted. Thats what my mom expects. Do it I said. Her face looked defiant. I beg you I said. Anything else she said. Yes step four is to make love to me on the beach. Nice try pretty Punjabi boy. But sorry nothings happening until we cross the finish line now. Ananya cmon I coaxed. We have to fix the family situation. Im too tense to think of anything else Ananya said. OK if tomorrow goes well then can we do it on the beach We will call it Operation Beach Passion. Well see. Beach Passion she smiled and smacked my head. Lets go back my dad is waiting for me. DX www.desibbrg.com The day tour of Goa went off without fireworks mainly due to the presence of a friendly Goan tour guide. We went to Bom Jesus Basilica the oldest church in Goa. Light a candle with someone you love the guide said. I had to choose between Ananya and my mother. Given the sensitivity of the trip I went with the latter. We also visited Dona Paula the climax location for the movie Ek Duje Ke Liye. Famous movie shot here. North Indian boy South Indian girl. Difficult to get along so they die the guide said. What else could have happened my mother smirked. I let it pass. Ananyas parents stayed back in Panjim for shopping. DX www.desibbrg.com We met Ananyas parents at dinner. All buffet meals at Park Hyatt were paid for as part of the package. They came to the coffee shop with three brown bags. Kavitaji this is for you Ananyas father passed the bags to my mother. No no what is the need my mother simpered as she took the gifts. The first bag had three saris. The second bag had four shirts for me. The third bag contained sweets savoury snacks and Goan cashews. I cruised the buffet counters with Ananya. Enough or does she want more Ananya said. Its cool. This is exactly what works I reassured her. All of us sat at the table and ate in silence. I always found it scary to eat with Ananyas family who ate their meals as if in mourning. If I found the lack of conversation awkward my mother hated it. She shifted in her seat several times. The only sound was cutlery clanging on the plates. My mother spoke after five minutes. See how times have changed. Our kids decide and we have to meet each other. Yes initially we had a big shock. But Krish lived in Chennai for six months. Once we knew him we were ok Ananyas mother said in her naturally stern voice. What OK You must be jumping with joy inside. Where would you find such a qualified boy like him my mother said. I prayed Ananyas mother wouldnt bite at the bait. Of course she did. Actually we do get qualified boys. Tamils value education a lot. All her uncles are engineers or doctors. Ananya had many matches from the USA. Yeah but they must be all dark boys. Were there any as fair as Krish Lookswise you cannot match Punjabis my mother said without any apparent viciousness in her voice. I almost choked on the spaghetti in my mouth. Mom they changed dessert today I coughed do you like bread pudding DX www.desibbrg.com And my brothers are also doing well my mother said. Ask Ananya what a wedding she has attended. They gave a Santro to the groom. You may have landed my son but it doesnt mean he has no value. Ananya imitated a stunned goldfish while I shook my head to deny responsibility for that statement. We havent trapped anyone Ananyas mother said finally. He used to keep coming to our house. W are decent people so we couldnt say no. Mom Ananya said. Why should I be quiet and get falsely accused We havent trapped anyone. Arent we suffering We all know Krishs father is against this. Our relatives will ask. Still we are accepting it Ananyas mother said. What are you accepting You dont even deserve my boy my mother said her voice nice and loud. Please dont shout. We are educated people Ananyas father said. Are you saying we are not educated my mother challenged. He meant we as in all of us right uncle We are all educated I hastily put in. Will you continue to take their side and clap while your mother gets humiliated my mother asked. No mom I said wondering if I had taken sides. I wont. Ananyas family spoke to each other in Tamil. Uncle looked especially distressed as he took short jerky breaths. My father is not well. We will go back to our room Ananya said. I looked at him in alarm. Krish we will see you later Ananya added. Mom I said in protest after they left. What Is there bread pudding Lets get some she said. DX www.desibbrg.com My mother and I came back to our room. She pretended nothing had happened. How does this remote work I want to watch my serial she said. Mom you could have behaved better there I said. My mother didnt answer in words. She responded in nuclear weapons. Tears rolled down her cheeks. Oh please I said. My mother didnt respond. She switched to her favourite soap where a son was throwing his old parents out of his house. She cried along with the TV parents correlating their situation to hers. Yeah right she was staying in Park Hyatt and ate four kinds of icecream and bread pudding for dessert. But of course all sons are villains playing into the hands of their wives. We cant have a conversation if you watch this stupid serial I said. This is not stupid. This is hundred percent reality she retorted. I switched off the TV. My mother folded her hands. Please have mercy on me she said dont subject me to this. The doorbell rang. I opened the door. Ananya stood there her face equally wreathed in ears. When estrogen attacks you on all sides there is not much you can do. What happened I said. Dads chest is hurting Ananya said fighting back her sobs. Should I call a doctor I said. No he is fine now. But something else can help. What I said. Is your mom inside Can I talk to her she said. Sure I stepped back. Ananya came in and told my mother who was sitting on the bed. Aunty I think you should apologise to my parents. Yes it is always my fault my mother mocked looking at me for support. DX www.desibbrg.com Aunty please dont generalize. We spent four hours in Panjim today buying gifts for you. My parents did whatever Krish asked us to do. What my mother said. Aunty you have insulted them. They have not trapped anyone. They were dead against Krish to begin with. And now they have accepted him theyd like some dignity. I am not.. my mother started to talk. OK enough I said. Both the women turned to me. Get your parents here I said lets talk this straight. Everyone has hurt everyone. No Krish today my parents didnt do anything Ananya said. My mother went into the bathroom. Ananya try and understand I whispered. You push my mother into a corner it will get worse. Lets make it a mutual apology. I walked Ananya to the door. I dont like this Ananya said at the door. Bring everyone here please I said. I came back into the room. My mother had washed her face. Ive called all of them here. Lets have a frank talk I said. She kept quiet. Whats up mom Say something I said. I wanted my mother to vent out before Ananya arrived with her parents. You saw Ananya Have you seen any girl talk to her motherinlaw like that my mother demanded. She is a little feminist type I admit I said. She is telling me to apologise. Can you imagine Minti talking to Dukes mother like that DX www.desibbrg.com She is different. She is confident independent and intelligent. But she is caring and sensitive too. She is too intelligent to be a good daughterinlaw. I had no clue how to respond to that but I had to calm her. She isnt that intelligent mom I assured her. She did economics but I beat her in that subject. We dont have bahus in Punjabis like that no matter how highprofile. We keep them straight my mother said. So we will too I said to pacify her. She is out of control. Mom she is here with her parents here. But I am marrying only her once she comes to our house we can control her. You only say no that South Indians are docile and scared I said whatever my mother needed to hear. I dont want my daughterinlaw to raise her voice or answer me back. She has to be under my thumb. Fine make her toe the line. I said but be normal now. I heard that Ananya said her face red. Ananya stood there with her parents. Damn I hadnt shut the door after Ananya left. Ananya I didnt realise you were here I said. And I didnt realise what I was doing. So I will be taught to toe the line after marriage. Well done Krish its not just your mother it is you as well Ananya said. Ananya I. Both women stared at me with tearready eyes ready to shoot their ultimate emotional laser weapons. Ananyas father tapped his wifes shoulders signaling departure. I told my parents your mother will apologise. But you guys are making bigger plans Ananya said and walked out of the room with her parents. I ran out and caught up with Ananya. Wait where are you going Were done she said her words firm despite the wobbly voice. What do you mean DX www.desibbrg.com Its over Ananya clarified between you and me. Are you breaking up with me What Ananya are you crazy I was manipulating her so shed calm down. I hate manipulations Krish and I hate manipulators even more Ananya said and broke into tears. Ananyas father came towards us and held Ananyas hand. Its not about communities. Its about the kind of people we want to be with he said. I stood alone in the corridor as Ananyas family walked away and the ground tilted around my feet. Needless to say Operation Beach Passion was not executed that night. DX www.desibbrg.com The Final Act Delhi Chennai Delhi Chennai DX www.desibbrg.com I turned workaholic after Goa spending fourteen maniacal hours a day in the office. I even bought the company laptop home to slog more. I achieved twice my work targets I didnt socialise I didnt see movies and I stopped going to restaurants. You have a great future Rannvijay my new boss told me. When Citibank sees a great future in you it means you have no life at present. Thanks Rannvijay I said. Though you could do with a shave. Whats with the new look Growing a beard And you look weak.... Take care of your health. I had tried to call Ananya several times after my return. Her parents would not pass her the phone if I called home. In her office the receptionist would tell me she was in a meeting. When I did reach her shed make an excuse and not converse. Ananya had a cellphone now but she stopped taking any calls from Delhi. One day I had a visitor in office from Citibank Mumbai. I requested him for his phone to make a call. Hello Ananya picked up the phone. Hi dont hang up. Its me I said. Krish please...whose phone is this A colleague from the Mumbai office. Listen I am sorry for the tenth time. Your receptionist will have a count of my earlier attempts. Krish this isnt about an apology. Then stop sulking. I am not sulking I am doing what maximises everyones happiness in the long term. I scratched my head to respond to her corporatevision type answer. What about you and me For my own sake I cant let make my parents feel small. Dont you miss me I said. DX www.desibbrg.com She kept silent. I checked the phone I had spent four minutes on the call. My colleague gave me puzzled looks as to why I had to use his phone. Ananya I said do you miss me Whats the point Say I forgive you what will change Will your mother change Will her bias towards me towards South Indians towards the girls change She is good at heart Ananya. Believe me she is I said. Oh really why dont you have her apologise to my parents then she said. It was my turn to stay silent. See she said. She is sensitive about everything right now. No she has a chip on her shoulder about being from the grooms side. I let out a sigh. Ananya what happened to our plans to elope Run away with me I said. And go where To my caring nurturing motherinlaw Ananya said No I want to marry where my parents are treated as equals. You should have been born as a boy I said. Thats so sexist I would have hung up if I didnt care for you. Do you care or not Dont you love me Isnt our love above everything Dont ask impractical questions she said her voice heavy. Can I do anything Anything I said desperately. Dont call me again. Help me get over this She said. I love you I said. Bye Krish. DX www.desibbrg.com I came home and sat down in front of the TV. For dysfunctional families television is the biggest boon. Without this electronic glue millions of Indian families will fall apart. The music channels showed songs of everlasting love. The couples seemed insanely happy. Perhaps they were all from the same state religion caste and culture and their parents were completely in sync with each other. Otherwise how can you fall in Love in India Some grownups in your house are bound to get pissed off. My mother didnt talk about Goa or show any signs of remorse. She did feel a little guilty about my low mood her penance consisted of cooking paneer dishes everyday. Ive made paneer bhurji. Youll have paranthas with it she said. I didnt respond. She took my lack of protest for a yes. She returned with dinner with twenty minutes. You want white butter my mother asked. I shook my head. Too much work in office There is a Canara Bank near our house. Should I talk to the manager for a job No office is OK I said. I tried to eat but couldnt. I had not eaten anything for three days. I hid the paranthas in my laptop bag when she wasnt looking. Shipra masi had recommended another girl. They have bungalow in Shalimar Bagh. Would you like to see her she said. I stared at my mother. What she said. Ill marry her. No need to see her. Fine I said. Krish dont say like that. When have I forced you DX www.desibbrg.com What is the point of me seeing these girls What am I supposed to check out in one hour Her complexion Figure fat or slim Is the marble in her home real None of this matters when you have to spend your life with the person so might as well save time. The parents should do the meeting. Whoever massages your ego more say yes. What happened to you These multinationals are sucking your blood my mother said. Can you apologize to Ananyas parents I said. My mother didnt respond. She stood up from the sofa and went into the kitchen. I followed her Why cant you do it I said. She didnt answer me. She dabbed at dishwashing detergent with a sponge and scrubbed the utensils. She addressed an imaginary audience First a useless husband now a useless son. I had thought after my sons marriage. I will get respect. I said yes to his choice of girl but at least behave like the girls side. Now he wants me to fall at their feet. What is so great about this girl Shipra is right everyone is selfish. Stop it mom I am not telling you to grovel. You can apologize over the phone. Apologize for what Is it wrong to expect what is due to me Didnt I look after your grandmother until she died Didnt Ananya help set Dukes family right Didnt you say yes then I was wrong. I hadnt met her parents then. Ive never met such a dry breed of people. Look at how they eat dinner like it is a punishment. Ananyas mother does she ever laugh Dark from outside dark from inside. The doorbell rang. My father had come back from another of his lacklusture business ventures. I switched off the TV and opened the door. I had told him the partial truth about Goa. I had said there was an office conference there and that I DX www.desibbrg.com was taking mom along. I had become quiet after my return and didnt even bother to fight with him anymore. He came inside and noticed the silence between my mother and me. There were several evenings these days at home when no one spoke to anyone. Have you decided to stop talking to your mother too my father asked as he sat on the sofa and removed his shoes. Its none of your business would have been my usual response. But I had fought enough with the world. Another argument wouldnt have yielded anything. Well be fine I said. I wished my mother would bring his dinner soon. Are you not enjoying your job my father said. The job is good. They said Ive a great future I said. I dont know why I said the last line. Somehow I felt the need to tell my father I was doing well. Why are you upset with your mother he said. Ok it was enough. Its none of your business I said. Are you telling me my own family is not my business he said. Dad enough. I am too tired to argue. My mother brought him dinner and I went back to my room. I took out Ananyas pictures. I tossed and turned in bed wondering what to do next. When you cant sleep your mind comes up with weird schemes. I couldnt do it over the phone. I had to go in person to do it. I woke up at four and took a shower. You are going to office now my mother said as she heard me get ready. I have a presentation Ill be back late I said. I took an auto to the airport. I plonked a months salary to take my crosscountry joyride. Same day return trip to Chennai please. I said at the Indian Airlines counter. DX www.desibbrg.com Chennai seemed embarrassingly familiar on my second trip. I could throw in Tamil terms and negotiate with autos. I knew the main roads. I reached Ananyas office at eleven. Hi Im Krish I said to the receptionist. Oh that Krish she said and called Ananya. Ananya came out. I opened my arms to embrace her but she shook hands. I came for the day I said as we sat in the HLL cafeteria. You shouldnt have she said. Whats with the unshaven look And why do you seem so weak Are you sick I want to meet your parents I said. There is no use. No matter how charming you are they dont trust you anymore Ananya said. Do you trust me Irrelevant she said. Ill go to your place I said. Dont Harishs parents are in town. They will visit my parents today. I took a deep breath to keep my temper in control. At least spend the day with me I said. I cant. I have work. Besides it is not good for my parents reputation. Blood rushed up my face. What reputation What about Ahmedabad What about when youd lie to them to meet me in Chennai What about Ratna Stores My voice was as loud as my body was tired. She stood up. Please dont create a scene at my workplace. DX www.desibbrg.com Please dont play with my life. Im not doing anything Be strong move on she said. Its not easy for me. So please let me be. She went back to her office leaving me still sitting there burning with fatigue and fury. I hadnt shaved for ten days. Other girls in the cafeteria stayed away from me. I resembled a Kollywood villain who could rape anyone anywhere anytime. My flight didnt leave until the evening. I had half a day and no money to spend. Like a total loser I decided to go to Citibank and visit Bala. Krish Bala said shocked at my presence and appearance. Hi how is the champion of the South Im fine but you look fucked he said I am I said and slumped in front of him. Bala ordered coffee for both of us. He pulled his chair forward eager to hear gossip from the other office. Is Citi Delhi screwing you Dont tell me you want to come back. Fuck off Bala you think Citibank can get the better of me I said. Someone clearly has. Boy your eyes. Do you have conjunctivitis I shook my head. He touched my arm. Dude you have high fever. Do you want to see a doc I want a drink. Can you get me a drink I said. Now It is not even lunchtime. My stomach roiled and I retched. Thankfully nothing came out and Balas office could maintain its preme conditions. You are sick. My cousin is a doctor Ill call him. He works in City Hospital on DX www.desibbrg.com the next street. What do girls think We cant live without them I muttered. I couldnt believe I was venting out to Bala. But I needed someone anyone. Bala dropped me at the clinic run by his cousin Dr Ramachandran or Dr Ram. Dr Ram had returned from the US two years ago after being a general surgeon working on cancer research and collecting several top degrees. He told me to go to the examination bed as he collected his instruments. Ill see you later then Bala said. You South Indians have too much brain but too little heart I said to Bala as he left. I heard that Dr Ram said as he came to me. He put a cold stethoscope on my chest. So this is a situation involving a girl Dr Ram asked. What girl When did you eat last he said. I dont remember I said. Whats that smell the doc said. He sniffed his way to my laptop bag. Stale paranthas stank up the room. Whats this Last nights dinner I said. Oh my laptop I hope it is OK. I opened my laptop and switched the power on. It worked fine. Can I see it Dr Ram said pointing to my computer. Yes sure are you looking to buy one I said. He didnt respond. He spent five minutes at my computer and gave it back to me. What You should rest and eat food for sure. But you also need to see a psychiatrist. DX www.desibbrg.com What Why I said. Sure I am bit of psycho but I didnt want to make it official. What is the name of the girl Dr Ram said. What girl I dont like girls. Bala said she is Tamilian. Ananya Swaminathan who stays in Mylapore right he said. I dont like Tamilians I screamed. And dont mention her name or neighborhood. Good because the psychiatrist I am referring you to is a Tamilian girl. Dr Iyer is upstairs. Please go now. Doctor I have to catch a flight. I am fine. I pushed myself off the bed. My legs felt as if the blood had drained from them. I couldnt balance. I fell on the floor. Dr Ram helped me back up. What problem do I have I said worried for the first time about my illness. He handed me the specialist referral letter as he spoke again. Theres no precise medical term. But some would refer to it as the early signs of a nervous breakdown. DX www.desibbrg.com So thats it Ive told you everything. I said. Dr Neeta Iyer broke into laughter as I finished my story. This is insane. You find comedy in my tragedy I was miffed. She didnt stop laughing. Im paying you to treat me I said and checked the time. And I had to leave for the airport in twenty minutes. It dawned on me that I had spoken to her for four hours. I had no money for this extravagance. Sorry she said you reminded me of my first boyfriend. He was North Indian. You didnt marry him He didnt want to commit she shook her head. Oh sorry I said. Its OK. Im over it. Of course you are you are a therapist. You should be able to cure yourself if nothing else. She walked to the window. Ah Krish it doesnt work like that. A broken heart is the hardest to repair. I sighed. Do you accept Citibank credit cards I opened my wallet. Its fine send me a cheque later she said. You should have eloped. We thought we will win our parents over. Wheres the joy of getting married if your parents wont smile on your wedding day I said. She came to me and patted my shoulder. You have to leave. So what do I do now Do you want pills she said. DX www.desibbrg.com You mean antidepressants Arent they bad for you Yeah but depends on how bad you feel right now. I dont want you googling for suicide recipes. I wont I said Ill probably wither away anyway. Is there another option apart from pills Theres therapy sessions like this. It takes a few months though. I can try and find a therapist for you in Delhi. No if my Punjabi family finds out Im done. Theyll say I am mental or something. Youre not. But you know there is one thing you can try yourself. What When you told me your story why did you mention that episode with Guruji At the Aurobindo Ashram Yes it didnt really have a connection with Ananya or her parents. But you remember everything he said. Yes about forgiveness. Yes maybe it had some significance she said. I kept quiet. The clock in her room told me it was time for my return journey. I took her leave. Airport vegamaa I said as I hailed an auto. DX www.desibbrg.com I knew I had to eat my brain knew this but my body wouldnt hear of it. The day after returning from Chennai I only had soup at office at home I pretended Id already had dinner. My mother asked me when I wanted to shave. She wanted to schedule a meeting with a new girl. I told her I had decided to keep a beard for the rest of my life. She made a face and left the room. My father came home at ten. He looked extra tired. His normally tucked in shirt was out and his hair wasnt neatly combed as usual. He sat in front of me. Ive eaten dinner he told my mother. I dont know why I even cook my mother grumbled as she left the room. You came back late last night my father said to me. I had reached home only at the midnight from the airport. I had to work late I said. Everything OK he said. I nodded. I had a really bad day my father said. My pension papers are stuck in government offices. Bloody lazy buggers. I nodded without paying attention. My thoughts were all over the place but none in his department. I felt immense longing and loathing for Ananya at the same time. I felt resentment towards my mother. My own problems at least in my mind were far bigger than some retirement files stuck in a government office. Now they have asked me to submit three different letters. I have to get them typed tomorrow my father said. When my father had to suffer he forgot his own vocation of making others suffer. He hadnt shouted once since he had come home. DX www.desibbrg.com Do you know a place where I can get letters typed You have a computer no my father said. Yes I do I said. My father continued to look at me expectantly. OK Ill type them now and get a printout from office tomorrow I said. I anyway wanted more work to distract myself. I opened my laptop. Thank you he said words we did not know lived inside of him. I wrote his three applications in the next thirty minutes. Hows your friend He said to me. Which friend I said. The girl who came from Chennai to attend the wedding he said. The mention of Ananya was enough to stir up my emotions. I felt like someone had punched me back in the stomach. Maybe I should take those antidepression pills I thought. I dont know. Must be fine I said after a minutes pause. You are not in touch with her Everyone had busy lives dad I dismissed. Your letters are done. Ill get a printout tomorrow. I shut down my computer. It is good that we talk sometimes my father said. Good night dad I said and left for my room. I lay in bed and that is when the depression hit me full force. Dr Iyer was right no pill could be as bad for me as I felt right now. I lay motionless. I felt like Id never be able to get out of bed again. I thought of every person in my life. One by one I convinced myself how each of them hated me. If I were gone tomorrow theyd all be happier. And considering how crappy I felt there was no reason for me to stick around anyway. I had no one I could talk to about my situation except five hundred bucks an hour. I hated money I hated Citibank I hated my job and I DX www.desibbrg.com hated all human beings on earth. Calm down Krish this is going to pass I told myself. This was the sensible me talking. No baby this time you are so fucked. This is how you will feel for the rest of your life the freakedout me said. Thats nonsense. Whatever crap happens in life tone gets used to it. You arent the first guy facing a breakup sensibleme said. Yes but nobody loves the way I do. So nobody feels as hurt as I do freakedout me said. Yeah right sensibleme said and yawned can we sleep You know you need to. Are you crazy How can you sleep when we can stay up all night and worry about this the freakedout me said. The worlds most sensible person and the biggest idiot both stay within us. The worst part is you cant even tell who is who. DX www.desibbrg.com Wheres dad I asked my mother He hasnt told me how many copies he wants. Though I sat for breakfast before going to office I drank only a glass of milk. Solids were still indigestible. I wanted to rush to work and occupy my mind before it sank into its blackhole hell again. Morning walk my mother said. Why doesnt he keep a mobile I said as I wore my shoes to leave for office. Get four copies of each worst case my mother said. It wasnt a big deal. However it didnt take a lot to piss me off these days. Like I have nothing better to do in office I said. All you grumpy people in the house please leave my mother said and folded her hands. I dont know when you will forget her. I dont know when youll end your drama I said. This girl. my mother started. Bye I said hurriedly and sprinted out of the house. I came late at night. I had stuck to juice and milk all day. Again no dinner Where are you eating these days and look at you so weak. And please shave my mother said. Is dad back I said Here are his papers. I took out the printouts and kept them on the table. My mother shook her head and told me that he hadnt come all day. Please give these to him I said. I went to my room and lay down in bed. Scared of blackhole land I kept the DX www.desibbrg.com lights on. I read the newspaper paying extra attention to each article to keep my mind busy. An item girl with her picture in a bikini said she wanted to be taken seriously. I found her request quite reasonable. My father returned at midnight. You think this is a hotel I said as I opened the door. I hadnt fought with him for weeks so it was about time anyway. My father didnt respond. Here are your printouts. I didnt know how many copies youd need. Thanks my father said. Where do you go so late Your real estate agency work cant take this long I said. I am not answerable to you my father said. And that is why we are an officially fuckedup family I said. I came back to my room. I slammed the door shut as I prepared for another night with the devils in my head. I promised myself to call Dr Iyer in the morning and get a prescription for those happy drugs. Fuck the side effects I couldnt take the mind monsters anymore. I fell semiasleep at three in the night. Persistent rings woke me up. I checked my watch a.m. Who the hell was calling at this hour I woke up groggy with a headache already in place. I reached the living room. I picked up the phone ready to scream at the milkman or whoever else felt it was OK to call now. Hello a female voice said. Ananya I said. I knew that voice too well. Thanks sweetie thank you so much Ananya said. Had she dialed the right number What I said still not fully in my senses. DX www.desibbrg.com You fixed everything. Thank you so much she said her voice superexcited. What did I do I blinked sleepily. Dont pretend You should have at least told me. Told you what That your dad is coming up to Chennai Ananya said. What I said and woke up in an instant. Stop behaving like a dumbo. He spent seven hours with my parents yesterday. He assured them that I would be treated like a daughter and apologised for any past misgivings. My dad I tried for clarification. Yeah my parents feel so much better after meeting him. In fact they asked me if I have a date in mind. Can you imagine Ananya spoke so fast it was hard to catch her words. Huh really I said. Oh wake up properly and call me. I love you baby. Sorry about the day before Id been so disturbed. Me too I said. What You too love me or you too are disturbed. Both I said but wait my dad came to your house You seriously didnt know. No I said. Wow she said please thank him from my side. I went to my parents room. They were still asleep. I dont know why but I did a totally sappy thing. I slid right into the middle and put an arm around them both. In a minute I was fast asleep. I woke up five hours later at ten. My parents were not in the room. I sprang out DX www.desibbrg.com of bed panicking at how late I was for office. I came outside. Wheres dad I said as I saw my mother. In the balcony my mother said. My father sat on a chair digging up mud in one of the flower pots. He saw me but kept quiet. I wondered what I should say to him. I picked up another spade and started digging with him. Dad you went to Chennai News travels fast he said. He didnt look up from the flower pot. Why I mean how come My son needed help my father said as he pulled out the weeds from the soil. His voice had been plain yet I felt a lump in my throat. He placed a sapling in the pot and put freshly dug mud around it. I came and sat next to him and pressed the soil with my thumb. How did you know I said. His eyes met mine he said Because I am your father. A bad father but I am still your father. He continued And even though you feel I have let you down in the past I felt I should do my bit this time. A life partner is important. Ananya is a nice girl. You shouldnt lose her. Thanks dad I said fighting back tears. Youre welcome he said. He gave me a hug. Im not perfect. But dont deprive me of my son in my final years he said. I hugged him back. Tears slipped out as I let go of any selfcontrol. The world celebrates children and their mother but we need fathers too. I closed my eyes. I remembered Guruji. I stood on top of a green mountain watching a beautiful sunrise. As I held my father the heavy cloak fell off making me feel light again. DX www.desibbrg.com I wont come for the wedding though my father said. Why I said surprised. Your mother wont go without her relatives. I dont know what I will do there if they are there. You wont come for your own sons wedding I said. Ananya is coming to our home only my father said. I felt too much gratitude towards him at that moment to be mad at him. You have to come. Im late for work but Ill convince you later I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Like I said much simpler for us if you get your relatives to Chennai Ananya said. How do I get them all I cant afford so many air tickets I said. We were on our countless prenuptial calls. They wont fly down themselves Ananya said. Are you crazy We have to take care of the baraat until they reach you of course. Only you understand these Punjabi customs Ananya said. Youd better too I said. Its a Tamil style wedding Ananya said. What I said. Yeah what else do you expect in Chennai Anyway wont your relatives like to see something different Actually no I said. Well see and you can take the train to Chennai. The Rajdhani Express takes twentyeight hours. Thats a long ride with relatives I said. Youve waited so long for this whats another day Ananya said and ended the call. DX www.desibbrg.com You really wont come I have your tickets. My father kept silent. My mother sat next to me at the dining table. Why does it have to be a choice Why cant mom get her relatives and you come as well I said. Why cant we be a normal family for once I thought. I guess there are no normal families in the world. Everyone is a psycho and the average of all psychos is what we call normal. He feels they have insulted him in the past my mother said. And he hasnt insulted them I said Anyway what does it have to do with my wedding Dad say something. You have my blessings. Dont expect my presence my father said. His drama never ends my mother said. He himself went to Chennai and said yes to Madrasis. This wouldnt even have happened otherwise. Now when everyone in my family is waiting for the wedding he stops them. Why Because he cant see them happy. Most of all he doesnt want to see me happy. She then broke into tears. Is that the case dad No Ive given you a choice he said. Which son will not want his father to come my mother said This is not a choice. This is blackmail. Whatever you want to call it. If this wedding is happening because of me then I should get to choose the guests. No dad I said Mom has equal rights too. Unfortunately I belong to both of you. So you decide my father said. My mother and dad looked at me. I paced up and down the room for ten minutes. Dad moms family has to come. You do what you have to do I said and left the DX www.desibbrg.com room. Rajji mama had arranged a twoman dholak band at the Hazrat Nizamuddin station. I helped locate the thirtyseven IItier AC berths reserved for my relatives in the Rajdhani Express compartment. Two of my mothers cousins had decided to join at the last minute and we had to accommodate them as well. My mother made up a wonderful story about my fathers viral fever that would be malaria. Everyone knew the reality and apart from the awkwardness of fibbing to Ananyas parents again people were relieved as my dad equaled to no fun. You cant talk half the things when your husband is here as Shipra masi told my mother. I stood inside the bogie matching everyones ticket to their berth. Rajji mama dragged me out. You have to dance a little no This is that baraat leaving he said. At four in the afternoon hundreds of bored passengers on the platform watched the free entertainment provided by our family. The dholak men jogged along the train and argued with mama over the payment. They couldnt squeeze much out of him as the train has picked up speed. I came inside my compartment which the ladies had turned into a sari shop. The entire lower berths were filled with the dresses everyone planned to wear for each of the functions. This is beautiful my seventyyearold distant aunt said as she fondled a magenta sari with real goldwork. Women never get too old for admiring saris. My younger cousins had taken over the next compartment. The girls had their makeup kits open. They discussed sharing the mascaras. I see why whole families get excited about a wedding theres something in it for everyone. I came outside to stand at the compartment door. The train whizzed past Agra Gwalior and Jhansi over the next few hours. I still had a day to go as the train traversed through this huge country cutting through states I had battled for the last year. These states make up our nation. These states also divide our nation. DX www.desibbrg.com And in some cases these states play havoc in our love lives. I came inside when the train reached Bhopal at dinnertime. My relatives couldnt contain their excitement that Rajdhani Express offered free meals. Take nonveg the Madrasis wont give you any Shipra masi advised everyone. OK aunty for the next three days there are no Madrasis only Tamilians I said. Shipra masi separated the foil from her chicken. Yes yes I know. Tamil Nadu is a state. But we are going to Madras only no Why does the ticket say Chennai Its the same. Like Delhi and Dilli Kamla mami said as she slurped her chicken sweet corn soup. Is it true their chief minister is an exfilm heroine my mothers cousin said. Yesji another aunt said these South Indian women are quite clever. God has given them a brain nothing else came another loose comment and I considered jumping off the train. DX www.desibbrg.com Ananyas father checked my clan into twenty rooms at the Sangeetha Residency in Mylapore. The rooms were basic but clean and airconditioned. What happened to your father We just met him he asked. Its a viral fever that could become malaria I said. Is that possible It happens in Delhi. Anyway whats the schedule I regulated the conversation. We have a puja tomorrow afternoon and another one in the evening. The wedding muhurtam will be in the morning day after tomorrow he said. Uncle what about a DJ There is no party I was aghast for my kith and kin. We have a reception party day after evening. Have your fun there he said and turned to my mother Kavita jee Shipra jee can I talk to you for a second My mother Shipra masi and Ananyas father stepped away from me and other relatives. They spoke for five minutes. My mother rejoined me. Shipra masi went to the reception to collect her keys. What I said as we climbed up the steps towards our hotel rooms. Nothing my mother said. Its my marriage. I deserve to know. They asked me if I wanted a special gift my mother said. Perhaps Ananya had recounted Mintis wedding to her parents. And What did you say I said eyeing my mother with suspicision. Dont talk to me in that voice my mother said. What exactly did you say mom I said my tone worse what Did you send him to buy a car or split ACs or what DX www.desibbrg.com Thats what you think of me. Dont you my mother said as we reached the first floor. She paused to catch her breath. Shipra masis expensive sandals could be heard four seconds before she arrived the first floor. See this stupid sister of mine. She said no to any big gifts Shipra masi said to me. You did I said to my mother. My mother looked at me. You will never understand how much I love you my mother said. I hung my head in shame. My mother smacked the back of my head. I deserved a slap. Shipra masi waved her hands as she spoke. You and your mother both the same impractical. She tells him I sent my son to do one MBA I am getting two MBAs in return. Ananya is the best gift Shipra masi said OK she earns a lot but Kavita why say no if someone is ready to give. Why not grab it. Because we are not that kind of people Shipra masi I said and gave my mother a hug she is all talk. But she can never behave like Dukes mother. Never I said. I came into my hotel room where ten cousins six aunts and four uncles sat on my bed. I sat on the floor as space was at a premium. We had twenty rooms to choose from but my relatives would rather be cramped together than miss out on juicy gossip session. The younger cousins battled for the TV remote. I repeated the schedule to my aunts. They are big bores. How can they do puja the whole day Kamla mami said. They dont even have sangeet my mother said. DX www.desibbrg.com I think they are trying to save money Shipra masi said. What language will the pujas be in Madrasi Another aunt said. Tamil maybe Sanskrit I said. I am not coming my mother said. I glared at my mother. Where do we eat an aunt expressed everyones concern. The meals are in the dining hall at the wedding venue. Lets go to bed we have to wake up early I said. We had planned to meet in the hotel lobby at seventhirty in the morning. We only left at nine. What is the address Rajji mama said. I took out the piece of paper Ananyas dad had given me. I cant read this Rajji mama said. I took the paper back. It said Arulmigu Kapaleeswarar Karpagambal Thirumana Mandapam Venkatesa Agraharam Street Mylapore Chennai After three attempts of reading it I had a headache. I counted the letters my wedding venue had fifty alphabets in it. Delhi never gets this complicated. One of my older cousins had her wedding in Batra Banquets another one in Bawa Hall. We struggled for twenty minutes on the streets of Mylapore before we reached the venue. Fortunately the locals had abbreviated the name of the place to AKKT Mandapam. From actors to political parties to wedding halls Tamilians love to keep complicated names first and then make acronyms for the same. What do you mean breakfast is finished Shipra masi said. Illa illa a potbellied darkcomplexioned hirsute chef said and shook his hand. He wore a lungi and a chefs cap. If he wore the cap no prevent hair in the food DX www.desibbrg.com he needed a body sheath given his hairy arms and chest. Orunimishum I said what happened Your son speaks Tamil Shipra masi said to my mother. My mother rolled her eyes. No I dont. Its a common word for wait a second I said. Now he belongs to them. Theyll make him do anything my mother lamented loudly. Mom please. Let me resolve this I said. What will you resolve They will make us cook food also my mother said. Everybody please sit in the dining hall I said then turned to the chef. Cant you make something Who will make tiffin then We have to serve it at eleven the chef said. I checked my watch. It was ninethirty. My family would have medical emergencies if kept hungry for that long. We want something now I said anything quick. What about tiffin the chef said. We dont want tiffin. Well only come back for lunch later. Girls side wants tiffin. They came for breakfast at . the chef said. Rajji mama came up to me. Bribe him he whispered. I thought about the ethics of bribing at my own wedding to feed myself. Wokay I go now I am busy the chef said and mumbled to himself pundai maganey thaayoli koodhi. Anna wait I said. The chef looked at me in amazement. How can a person with a heavy Delhi accent toss in a Tamil word or two DX www.desibbrg.com I kept a hundredrupee note in my hand and shook hands with him. Perplexed he examined the currency. We are giving you out of happiness my uncle said. I can make upma fast the chef said. What is upma my uncle said. Salty halwa. No not upma. Can you make dosas I said. For dosa one by one making no staff now. Then lunch also delayed the chef said mournfully. We settled on idlis. There would be no sambhar. However the chef had drum full of coconut chutney enough to pave roads with. My family sat in the dining hall as servers placed banana leaves in front of them. We have to eat leaves Shipra masi said What are we Cows Its the plate I said and there is no cutlery. They have hardly any expense in weddings how lucky Kamla aunty said. Forty of us consumed at least two hundred idlis. Ananyas father came when we had finished. There wasnt breakfast I am sorry he said. Its fine I said We came late. Hello Kavitaji Ananyas father said with folded hands as per Ananyas instructions. He took the bucket of idli from the servers and served one to my mother. Hello my mother responded a hint of pride in her voice as her sibilings saw her being served by the girls father. This is what grownups live for anyway considering they have so little fun otherwise. Hows Krishs father feeling now Ananyas father said next. DX www.desibbrg.com Hes better he had soup last night and porridge in the morning. He is taking rest now. He sends his regards my mother said. Ananyas father nodded in concern. What are the ceremonies today uncle I asked for my relatives benefit. First we have the Vrutham the wedding invitation prayers. We also have Nischayathartham the formal engagement ceremony where we set the auspicious time for the wedding and give gifts to close relatives Ananyas father said. My aunts only paid attention to the last four words. We came to the main hall the center of action for the next two days. Every ceremony of my wedding took place in this room. In the middle of the hall there was fire urn not too different from Punjabi weddings. However in our weddings people only came around the fire after eating their dinner and dessert. Here everyone lived around the fire. I sat down on the floor. Four priests started the mantras. Close relatives sat on the floor while distant and arthritic ones sat on chairs in the back rows. The priests at the Vrutham chanted so loud it scared some of my little cousins into crying and made it impossible to talk. My aunts behind me shifted their positions several times. Should we do a city tour later Kamla aunty said. What is there to see in Chennai If you want to see Madrasis there are enough in this room Shipra masi said. I saw Ananyas relatives. I recognized few aunts. The younger cousins had come down from abroad. They sat in traditional Tamil attire clutching their mineral water bottles. Ananya didi Minti said as Ananya came inside. She wore a maroon Kanjeevaram sari with a mustard yellowgold border. Her tightly braided hair made her look like a cute schoolgirl. Her face had make up and Ananya looked prettier than any girl on any Tamil film poster every made. Her eyes looked deep due to kaajal around it. For a few seconds I couldnt recognize her as my Ananya. DX www.desibbrg.com Was this the same girl I met in the mess line fighting for sambhar Our eyes met briefly. She gave me a little smile enquiring on how she looked. I nodded yes she looked more beautiful than she ever had. The prayers continued for another hour. Smoke filled the room. The priests kept adding twigs and spoonfuls of ghee to the fire. Ananya and I exchanged glances and smiled several times. Was it really happening Was I finally getting married with consent from everyone I shared my DNA with The priest asked for my father. My mother told him he was unwell. I thought of dad again. Why are adults so stuck up Whats your grandparents village Ananyas dad asked me. There priests required it for the Nischayathartham ceremony. I had no idea. I turned to my mother. She turned to my aunts. My aunts debated what answer to give them. Lahore my mother said after their discussion. Lahore in Pakistan Ananyas father said. He seemed worried I was scared hed change his mind again. My grandparents had come to Delhi after the partition I explained to him. He nodded. Uncle when is the marriage done Like it is irreversible and no one can object to it afterwards What do you mean he said. Nothing I said as the priest called me to make a donation. I gave him a hundredrupee note. He declined it with full fervor. Dont give him directly put it in the thamboolam Ananyas father said referring to the puja plates. I placed the money in the plate. I decorated it with a banana paan leaves and DX www.desibbrg.com betel nut. I offered it again and the priest accepted it. He announced the wedding details the nonabbreviated name of the venue the lagnam the star and tomorrows date. Sixthirty muhurtam the priest said. In the morning Rajji mama said shocked. Ananyas relatives congratulated each other on the formal setting of the time. My relatives were aghast. This is a wedding or a torture Its like catching an early morning flight Kamla aunty said. Fortunately Ananyas mother calmed the ladies by bringing in ten bags full of gifts. Mrs Kamla she announced reading out from the first bag. Each gift had the receivers name relationship with me and a code word for what was inside. Me Kamla aunty said and raised her hand like a child marking attendance in class. Theres something about presents that turns everyone into kids. Well open them in our hotel Shipra masi said after the end of the prize distribution ceremony. And now we will have lunch Ananyas father said inviting us all to the dining hall to a meal of rice sambhar rasam vegetables curd and payasam. Were trapped. No paneer here Kamla aunty said as we moved to the paneerless dining hall. DX www.desibbrg.com So whats the plan for tonight Rajji mama said after we came back to the hotel. There is dinner at the dining hall at eight I said. Please I cant have any more rice Shipra masi said. The ladies had opened their Kanjeevaram sari gifts. I had told Ananya to leave the price tags on. My relatives praised Ananya a little more as they noticed each sari cost three thousand bucks. Whats after dinner Rajji mama said. The muhurtam is sixthirty. Lets sleep early. See Kavita how your son has become a Madrasi Kamla aunty said and everyone laughed like she had cracked the best joke in the world. I made a face. How can we sleep early It is your wedding Kamla aunty pulled my cheeks. So what do you want to do I said. Well organize a party. Mintis daddy come lets go Kamla aunty said and they went out. And you go the beauty parlour to get a facial my mother said. Me Yes but be careful. The beauty parlours can make you black Shipra masi said and my clan found another reason to guffaw like Punjabis can. I cant really call the party Rajji mama organized for me as a bachelors party especially since all my aunts were present. However the makeshift arrangements gave it a singleguybash feel. Rajji mama had come back with two bottles of whisky one bottle of vodka and a crate of beer. Kamla aunty also brought chips and juice for the ladies. Let the ladies also have a drink tonight Rajji mama proclaimed as many DX www.desibbrg.com aunties feigned horror. My cousins had already booked the vodka bottle. Ice Rajji mama told a waiter at the hotel and gave him hundred bucks. He returned with a bucketful. You have a music system Rajji mama asked the waiter. The waiter agreed to borrow one from his friend for another hundred bucks. The choice of music was a challenge though and we had to limit ourselves to the soundtracks of the movies Roja and Gentleman. The lyrics were Tamil but at least the tunes were familiar. After two drinks you will be able to understand the Tamil words also Rajji mama said. The men took Room my room. The women went to while the teenage and young cousins were in . The underthirteens stayed in watching cartoon channels on cableTV. The underfives and over seventyfives were cooped up in the latter babysitting the former. Rajji mama kept shuttling from to to gossip with the ladies and discuss stocks and real estate with the men in . Its eleven I reminded my relatives We should sleep Oh shut up Rajji mama said and hugged me happily. If we sleep now we wont wake up at all. Lets keep going until morning. The party continued and rooms and turned into discos. The Indian soundtrack was played five times. I realized if my relatives didnt sleep we may never make it to the wedding. I went down to the lobby at half past midnight. Call the cops I told the front desk. What the manager said You are the groom. Yes and I have a sixthirty muhurtham. I need to be there at five with all of them. There are in no mood to rest. The manager laughed. Rajji mama had bribed him well. Dont worry sir I will stop them in half an hour. DX www.desibbrg.com A car stopped outside the hotel just then and a person stepped out. Even in the darkness I could tell who it was. I immediately sprinted up the stairs my heart beating fast. Rajji mama was closedancing with Kamla aunty in to a sad song from Roja. My dads here I announced. In two minutes flat our nightclubs shut down as if there was a police raid. Everyone went into their rooms to sleep. The corridor was stark silent as my dad climbed up to the third floor. Dad I said. We looked at each other for a few seconds. He had decided to come after all. I couldnt think beyond that fact. I didnt push him for a reason either. He was like me we Indian men dont do emotions too well. You havent slept Arent you getting married in a few hours he asked mildly. I didnt respond. He walked towards . I stopped him. The last thing I wanted him to see was the debauchery of my maternal uncles. There are more rooms upstairs. This one needs repairs I said and took him to the next floor. I left him there to change. My mother was in trying to clean it as fast as possible. Its fine he is upstairs I said. Whats he doing here my mother said Hes come to create trouble No I said Hes fine. He came to attend my wedding. Now He has come now Its OK mom you go to bed. Ill tell him you are asleep I said I kissed my mother on the cheek and went up. My father had changed into a white kurta pajama. Thank you dad I said. Dont be silly he said. Wheres your mother DX www.desibbrg.com Everyone slept early. We have to wake up at four I said. Oh Im keeping you up. Are you sleeping here I nodded and switched off the lights. I lay down next to only him probably for the first time in twenty years. I love you son he said his eyes closed. I choked up. The words meant as much as to me as when Ananya had said them the first time. I love you too I said and wondered which love story I was really chasing anyway. DX www.desibbrg.com I had to pour mugfuls of water over their face to wake up my relatives. Rajji mama had a severe hangover. I had slept only three hours and had a splitting headache. We asked room service for triple strength coffee. This is inhuman how can they get married at this time my mother said. She opened her suitcase to take out her new sari for the occasion. Ananyas father had sent a bus to our hotel for the twohundredmetre journey. I waited outside while every female in my clan blowdried hair and applied lipstick. Panic calls started at fivefifteen. The priests had lit the fire. Chants have begun Ananyas father said. Two more old ladies coming real soon I said and hung up the phone. We reached the mandapam at fivethirty. Ananyas relatives had already taken the best seats. I waded through them to sit in front of the priests. The mother sits here the priest said and if the father is not there then a senior male relative My father is here I said. Ananyas parents sprang up from their seats. Welcome Ananyas father said How is your fever What fever my father said as he took his place. The priests continued their fervent chants. Rajji mama passed on Saridon strips as everyone with a hangover took a pill. Ananyas uncles passed copies of The Hindu to each other as they continued to gather knowledge through the wedding. Come Krish Ananyas father said after five minutes of prayers. What DX www.desibbrg.com You have to change. I am supposed to help you he said matteroffactly. I had worn a new rustcolored silk kurta pajama my mother had bought for me. This doesnt work I said. Ananya giggled. Ananyas father shook his head and stood up. I followed him to the room next to the main hall. He ominously bolted the door. Take off your clothes he said. What I said as he fingered my kurtas hem to help me take it off. I will do it myself I said hastily. I removed my kurta. Pajama also he said reminding me of my college ragging days. Is this necessary I snapped wondering if my striptease would make the mantras more effective. He didnt respond. His hands were about to reach my pajama cord when I decided to get rid of my modesty myself. I had worn a white underwear with Mickey Mouses prancing all over it. Why are you wearing this I had brought a pack of six Disneythemed underwear. Considering I was going to get married and Ananya like cartoon characters I had thought shed find it cute. Of course I couldnt give this reason to my future fatherinlaw. How was I to know it will be on display I said. Ananyas dad had worried expression. Why whats wrong I said. You have to wear this veshti Ananyas dad said and gave to me a translucent creamcolored lungi. It resembled the bathing dress worn by Mandakini in Ram Teri Ganga Maili. I have to wear this How I held it up. The early morning rays came right through it. Come Ill show you Ananyas dad said and horror of horrors tucked half his DX www.desibbrg.com hand into my underwear. I wondered if a groom can sue his fatherinlaw for molestation. Please let me try first I said. Of course out of nervousness I couldnt focus. The veshti kept slipping and I stood there in my Mickey Mouse underwear almost in tears. Allow me it will take only a minute Ananyas father said gently like a doctor convincing a kid for an injection. I closed my eyes. This is the absolute last last humiliation I will go through to get the love of my life I thought. A few hours more and this will be over. Uncles hand came close for comfort as he tried to ensure a snug fit. Some say this ceremony is designed to ensure that the groom has his equipment in place. Well he surely did a good job finding out. Are we done I said as uncle adjusted the final pleats. I saw myself in the mirror. My first topless meeting with the world was about to take place. Little Mickey Mouses were grinning through my Translucent veshti. OK it is only for a little while more I told myself. See now all your wedding pictures will have Mickey Mouse uncle said confirming that my humiliation would continue for the rest of my life. Do you want to change your underwear You can wear mine. Should we exchange He asked. I looked at him wondering if he actually said what he just said. Lets go. I have to get married. We came outside and my cousins burst into laughter when they saw me. Mickey Mouse my fiveyearold cousin screamed ensuring that all guests would now freely spot it. Ananya sat in a gorgeous nineyard dark silk sari. She wore diamond and gold necklaces. She looked like an accessible goddess. Whats with the underwear she whispered to me. DX www.desibbrg.com I bought it for you . I mean us I said. Excuse me she said as the priest scolded us for talking and asked to focus on the prayers. Someone tied a scarf over my eyes so I couldnt see anything for ten minutes as prayers continued. It could be the punishment for talking to the bride during the wedding but no one explained why. Prayers continued even after the scarf was removed. OK now you go for Kashi Yatra the priest said after an hour. He gave me an umbrella and a copy of the Gita. Whats that I said. Ananyas father gave me the details. I had to stand up and announce I wasnt interested in the wedding and was going to Kashi or Varanasi to become a sadhu. I didnt know why they gave me an umbrella but I had to open it and place it over my head as I walked out. Ananyas father would come after me and convince me that I should marry his daughter instead. I decided to do an extra good job with this ceremony especially as I had messed up with the veshti. I stood up gave Ananyas parents a disgusted look and sprinted out of the hall. Ananyas father followed me but I walked way faster than him. I came to the main road outside the hall. I walked on to the street. An auti saw me and came near me. Where where He said his engine still sputtering in first gear. Kashi I said. Kashi where he said. Varanasi in U.P. I said. Central Station Seventy rupees sir he said. I turned over and saw Ananyas dad twenty metres behind me. Well you only get married once so I decided to do the best Kashi Yatra ceremony ever. I sat inside the auto. The auto sped off. DX www.desibbrg.com Hey Ananyas dad screamed at full volume. Whos that the auto driver said. Nothing I said stop. I came out of the auto Ananyas father came running to me. What are you doing he said panting after the jog. Going to Kashi I said and smiled you didnt tell me when to stop. He grabbed my arm tight. Come inside he said dragging me towards the mandapam. Hey arent you supposed to convince me I said. We had some more Tamil ceremonies. We had Maalai Maatral which involved an exchange of garlands like the Punjabi jaimala. However Ananyas relatives lifted her high making it difficult for me to reach her head. My own relatives took a while to realise that it was only a game and almost got into a fight with one of Ananyas uncles. After that we had Oonjal where Ananya and I sat on a swing as her relatives fed us small pieces of banana soaked in milk. Finally we came back to sit around the fire. Ananya sat on her fathers lap for the final kanyadaan. Yes I whispered to myself its almost over. Ananya and I held a coconut dipped in turmeric. Ananyas mother poured water over it. Ananya couldnt hold back her tears sitting in her fathers lap. I tied a gold necklace with a flat rectangular pendant around her neck called the taali in the Mangalyadharanam. The priests told us to stand up for the Saptapathi or the seven sacred steps. Ananyas sari and my veshti were connected in a knot and held hands. I had felt her touch after months. Are you OK I said as she sniffed. You are not a girl you wont understand Ananya said and thus began a lifetime of you wont understand statements married men have to endure DX www.desibbrg.com everyday. I placed my feet under Ananyas feet and helped her take seven steps around fire. I slipped silver rings onto her toes. Everyone clapped as I came back up. What I said. Its over now go around the room and take blessings from everyone the head priest said. I looked at Mr Swami and his wife. They were no longer Ananyas parents. They were my inlaws. I had done it. The two states had become one. Do namaskaram the priest instructed us. Ananya and I lay fully flat on the ground in front of every elder relative to bless us. It is the only wedding ritual in the world that involves a workout. My blessings are always with you my father said as he stopped us from lying down fully in front of him. God bless you Shipra masi said as I lay down in front of her But Im sleepy. Lets go back to the hotel. DX www.desibbrg.com He has a speech I said. Ananya and I sat on regal chairs at the venue of our reception. At least this function felt familiar to my relatives as they saw food stalls in the open garden. We were at the Madras Boat Club. Coloured lights twined around the trees the lakeside venue was a welcome change from the unpronounceable smokefilled mandapam. Yeah he wanted to do a powerpoint but I stopped him. He even came to the hotel to show the speech to you. When I said I was there only. Sleeping all day Ananya said. He only heard snores. You didnt sleep I said. No way we have so many out of town guests. I havent slept for the last two days. So how do you manage to look so beautiful I said. She blushed. It matched her clothes. She wore a pink lehnga with heavy gold and silver embroidery for the evening a surprise for my relatives and a bit of shock for her own aunts. However it was too late and Ananya was already married to me. Screw you Pure Harish I thought though I cursed myself for thinking of him at all. Congratulations some random person came to the stage to meet us and we smiled for pictures for the hundredth time. Dinner did have North Indian choices but the flavours were a bit off. Theyve made gobi aaloo with coconut oil Minti complained. We are all going back tomorrow I said. Youll have your paranthas soon. Now dont make a face and eat icecream. When are we cutting the cake one of my younger cousins said pointing to DX www.desibbrg.com the eggless cake kept in the middle of the garden. Next to the cake there was a dais with chairs around it. A waiter rang a handbell announcing the speech and cakecutting ceremony. Relatives came around and sat on chairs. The Tamilians and Punjabis looked at each other. People had not come to attend the wedding they had come to a live human museum of the other community. But when will the DJ start my cousin said. Patience I said. Ananya and I stood next to the cake. Ananya took the mike to speak first. Thank you everyone for coming here. I am so grateful to all of you that you decided to share our happiness. Yes ours is quite a different wedding and it has taken us a while to get here making it all the more special. Id like my amazing father to share a few words with you. Ananay clapped and the rest of the crowd applauded as well. My father and mother sat together with a smile on their face. At least for tonight theyd decided to get along. Hello everyone Ananyas dad said Id like someone from the boys side later to say a few words as well. He looked at my father. My father folded his hands to say no. Ill talk Rajji mama said and raised his hand. He had obviously found the Boat Club bar. Welcome everyone Ananyas father started I never liked giving speeches. However in the last year helped by my soninlaw Ive gained the confidence to talk in public. Everyone turned to look at me. OK making office presentations is one thing confessionals in frfont of your community auite another. I hoped he knew what he was doing. I know the number one topic all of you have discussed in this party why is DX www.desibbrg.com Swami marrying his daughter to a North Indian fellow I know it as we would have done the same. Sniggers ran through the crowd. In fact when Ananya first told us about Krish we were quite upset. As all Tamilians know we are so proud of our own culture. We also thought our daughter is one in million she will get the best of boys in our own community. Why must she go for a Punjabi boy Everyone who wore a Kanjeevaram sari int the crowd nodded. The Punjabis kept a straight face. We did our best to discourage her. We didnt trat Krish well even though he moved to Chennai for us. We even showed her Tamil boys. But you know kids of today they do what they want to do. This time all gave understanding nods. So why do parents object to this he said and adjusted his glasses. It is not only about another community. It is the fact your daughter has found a boy herself. We as parents feel disobeyed left out and disappointed. We bring our children up from babies to adults how can they ignore us like this All our frustration comes out in anger. How much we hate love marriages isnt it Ananyas aunts smiled. But we forget that this has happened because your child had love to give to someone in this world. Is that such a bad thing Where did the child learn to love From us after all the person they loved first is you. Ananya clasped my arm and clenched it tight. The crowd listend with full attention. Actually the choice is simple. When your child decided to love a new person you can either see it as a chance to hate some people the person they choose and their families. Which is what we did for a while. However you can also see it as a chance to love some more people. And since when did loving more people DX www.desibbrg.com become a bad thing He paused to have a glass of water and continued. Yes the Tamilian in me is a little disappointed. But the Indian in me is quite happy. And more then anything the human being in me is happy. After all weve decided to use this opportunity to create more loved ones for ourselves. When he kept the mike down Ananya hugged him hard. The crowd burst into applause. Ananya and I cut the cake through the resounding claps. We fed each other and our respective inlaws a piece. The cameraman gathered both sets of parents for a picture. Ananya see both our parents. They are smiling I said. Rajji mama stood up and came to the mike for his speech. Stop Mintis daddy he has had six pegs Kamla aunty said. Rajji mama took the mike and raised his hands. ladies and gentleman he said. I went up to him. Rajji mama enough. You are too cool to make boring speeches I whispered in his ear. Really We should answer them no he said. Its not a competition I said. He said into the mike Ladies and gentlemen of Tamil Nadu thank you very much. Now we invite you to some Punjabistyle dancing with the DJ at the backside. My cousins flew off their chairs and surged towards the dance floor. The song collection was a mixture of Tamil and Hindi film music. They had one Punjabi music CD which Rajji mama had instructed to play in a loop. My family dominated the dance floor but Ananya urged her aunts and uncles to join in as well. I guess they were my family too now. DX www.desibbrg.com Rajji mama avoided a bad fall while trying a particularly difficult Bhangrabreak dance fusion step to impress my new relatives. My cousins pushed me and Ananya together for a close dance. I held Ananya to me as we moved on the dance floor. Ananya I whispered in her ear. What she said softly. I love you and your father and your mother and your brother and your relatives I said. I love you and your clan too she said. We kissed as Tamils and Punjabis danced around us. So the selfimposed exile is over now You said well only do it when we cross the finish line I said. Is that all you men think about she said. Only for the sake of uniting the nation I said. DX www.desibbrg.com Epilogue A couple of years later Do I have to be here I asked Ananya who lay in the delivery room. A curtain spread midway across the bed separated her lower and upper body. The doctors had given her a halfbody anesthetic which enabled her to stay awake during Csection. A team of specialists hid behind the curtain cutting up her stomach. He has a knife I said peeping at the doctors. My head felt dizzy. Dont freak me out. Talk about something else she said. Hows the book going Well the fifth publisher rejected it yesterday I said and stood up again to take a peek. At least I can go to the sixth one now wow there is blood. Sit down if you cant handle the sight and stop being so scared. I cant feel a thing because of the epidural she said. The doctor had recommended a caesarian without general anesthesia. If only you could see. I said wow I see a leg. Its like Aliens . Shut up she said. Hey its a boy I said. Does he look like me I dont know. I havent seen the face yet. Ive only seen the youknowwhat. The doctor took out the whole baby. Thank you doctor thank you so much I said emotionally and moved to shake his hand. Wait the doctor said through his masked face. What Ananya said. I dont know said. Oh wait theres another leg. Wow theres another boy. Twins she said in disbelief looking ready to faint. DX www.desibbrg.com Yes the doctor said. Congratulations. The nurse cleaned up the two babies and gave them to me. Be careful she said as I took one in each arm. You are from two different states right So what will be their state the nurse said and chuckled. Theyll be from a state called India I said. THE END  ";

What I said wondering if Id be spending my firs night in Kola on the streets. Come he beckoned. He opened the gate and kept my suitcases in his cabin. We climbed up the steps of the first apartment block Will you share with other boys Three to a room the watchman could I said but how will I study I want a private one however. will try.Studies or not wanted to be left alone Okay fifth floor the watchman said. We climbed up three floors. I panted due to the exertion. The extreme neat did not help Kota is hot get used to the weather the watchman saidItis horrible outside. That is why it is a good place to stay inside and We reached the fourth floor I struggled to catch my breath. Hecouidot stop talking So you will study for real or you are just paused midsentence.

The lady had converted barely stand in the tiny room together. I t s perfect for studying said the watchman who probably hadnt studied even one day in his whole life. Take it it is within your budget I shook my head. The room had no windows The old lady seemed arrogant or deaf or both. She kept a grumpy face throughout. I did not want to live here. Why couldnt I study in my Varan asi What was so special about this godforsaken place I wanted to get out of Kota ASAP. I walked out of the flat. Hie watchman came running after me. If you fuss so much you wont get anything Til go back to Varan asi then said. I thought about how different my life would have been if had answered six more multiplechoice questions I thought of Raghav who would at this moment be attending his orientation at the BHU campus. I thought of Aarti and our hearttoheart conversations. I thought of Babas ill health and his determination to kick me into this dump. I fought back tears. I started to walk down the stairs. Or increase your budget the watchman said as he came up behind a storeroom into a study and bedroom. he lady watchman and I couldme cant. have to pay for food and the coaching classes I said. We walked down the steps and reached the ground floor.

Big deal I could take death tm from Varaxiai where the world comes to die The student who rented it. He didnt get through so he killed himself Two years ago. it has been empty since did not respond. Now you see why didnt show it to you Birju said. Til take it I said. Sure TVeseen dead bodies burning and iloating all my life. I dont care if some loser hanged himself The watchman picked up my suitcases. We went to the third floor in the next flat. A couple in their sixties stayed there. They kept the place immaculately clean. The spartan tolet room had a bed table cupboard and fen Fifteen hundred I said to the couple The watchman gave me a dirty look. The couple looked at each other. T know what happened here I said mMs fine hy oief Biijn CHETAN BHAGATThe old gentleman nodded. T am RL Soni I iisedtowork in the PWD He extended his hand. I gave him a firm handshake. T m Gopal an IT repeater I plan to get in this time I said. dumped the brochures on the bed and took off my shoes and socks. I had spent the day visiting various coaching schools. At three in the afternoon my room felt at ignition point Mr Soni gently knocked on the door of my room. Your lunch he said and kept the tiffin on my study table I nodded in gratitude. It felt too hot to exchange pleasantries. I had arranged for my meals and a place to stay. However my main challenge in Kola apart from constantly fighting off thoughts about Aarti was to enrol in a good study programme had spent the last three days doing the rounds of every coaching school I took in their tail claims about zapping any primate into an IITian I went through their superflexible not to mention superexpensive fee structures Bansai Resonance and Career Path seemed to be everyones top choices. Each of them had their own rather difficulty entrance exams. In fact Kota now had small coaching shops to coach you to get into the top coaching classes From there you would be coached to get into an engineering college. Once there you study to become an engineer. Of course most engineers want to do an MBA. Hence the same coachingclass cycle would begin again. This complex vortex of tests classes selections and preparations is something every insignificant Indian student like me has to go through to have a shot at a decent life Else I could always take the job of Birju the watchman or if I wanted it simpler hang myself like my erstwhile roomresident Manoj Dufta I switched on the same fan that helped Manoj check out of the entrance exam called life The moving blades recirculated the hot air in the room. CHETAN BHAGATCalled home Mr Soni said. M did said. Mr Soni asked me this question at least twice a day. I guess Manoj Dutta didnt call home often enough leading to his loneliness and early demise. Keep them informed okay Nobody loves you more than your parents Mr Soni said as he left the room. I shut the door and removed my shirt. I hadnt rowed in ten days. My arms felt flabby. I wanted to exercise but had to figure out the ten million brochures first. I had indeed called Baba twice. He seemed fine. I told him I had started preparing for next year even though couldnt bear to open any textbook. I didnt care. Whichever coaching class joined would make me slog soon. I wanted to talk to Aarti first. Id called her four times but could not speak to her even once. Her mother had picked up the phone the first two times. She told me politely that Aarti had gone out with friends once and another time to submit her college admission form. called twice the next day and Aartis mother picked up again. I hung up without saying anything. I did not want Aartis mother going why is this boy calling you so many times from so far It did not create a good impression. Aarti had mentioned she would get a cellphone soon. I wished she would. Everyone seemed to be getting one nowadays at least the rich types. Aarti did not have a number to reach me. I would have to try again tomorrow. I picked up a greencoloured brochure. The cover had photographs of some of the ugliest people on earth. The pictures belonged to the IIT toppers from that institute. They had grins wider than models in toothpaste ads but not the same kind of teeth. Since my favourite hobby was wasting time i spent the afternoon comparing the brochures. No I didnt compare the course material success rates or the fee structures. In any case everyone claimed to be the best in those areas. I compared the pictures of their successful candidates who had the ugliest boy who had the cutest girl if at all. There was no point to this exercise but there was no point to me being in Kota.REVOLUTION I saw the Bansal brochure the holy grail of Kotaland Bansal students had a chip on their shoulder even though they werent technically even hi a college. The Bansalites were Kotas cool I had to crack their exam. However I had little time to prepare for the test scheduled in three days. In factj many of the coaching classes had their exams within a week The next set of exams was a month away had to join something now. Staying idle would make me go mad faster than the earlier occupant of this room.. Each institute asked for a thousand bucks for an application form. Whether they selected you or not whether you joined or not the fee had to be paid. I had fifty thousand rupees with me and Baba had promised me more after six months. I had limited money I could only apply selectively. I shortlisted five coaching institutes Bansal Career Path Resonance and two new cheaper ones called AimllT and Careerlgnite. The brochure of AimllT said We believe in the democratic right of every student to be coached hence we doht conduct our own entrance tests. It meant they werent in the same league as the top ones to be choosy. They might as well have written Tf you have the cash you are welcome I spent the rest of the afternoon filling the tiresome and repetitive forms. I kept myself motivated by saying I would call Aarti once more before dinnerI went out for an evening walk at p.m. Jhe streets w i m l i l e d With nerdy students out for their daily dose of fresh air. I found an STD booth. Tiello Mr Pradhan said in a firm voice I cut the phone on reflex. The meter at the STD booth whirred. You still have to pay the shopkeeper said sourly. I nodded. needed to speak to someone. I had already called Baba in the morning I called Raghav. Raghav its me. Gopal From Kota I said my last word soft. Gopal Oh wow we were just talking about you Raghav said. CHETANBHAGATMe Really With who I said. Aartis here. Flow are you man Hows Kola We miss you. Aarti is at your place I asked puzzled. Yeah she wanted me to help her choose her course. She is not sure about Psychology Aarti snatched the phone from Raghav midsentence Copal Where are you I n Kota of course I called you said. T wanted to ask her why she had come to Raghavs place. However it didnt seem the best way to start a conversation. Why didnt you call back I dont even have a number to call yoii she said. Will ask my landlord if can receive calls Tell me when you will be home. J will call you. I want to talk. Talk now. Whats up How can talk now Why You are with Raghav said. Sof What are you doing at Raghav s place Nothing. Generally When girls use vague terms like generally it is cause for specific concern. Or maybe not. It could be my overactive mind. T have to choose a course. Should I do Psychology or BSc Home Science she said What do you want to do L saki T have to finish my graduation before becoming an air hostess. That s the only reason am doing it I want an easy courselOh so your air hostess plans are not dead said.Well Raghav says one should not give up ones dream so easily. Maybe BSc Home Science is better no Sort of related to hospitality industry. Or should leave Agrasen and join hotel management I kept quiet. Raghav advising her Who is he A career counsellor Ordoes he have the license to preach now because he has a fucking JEE rankREVOLUTION Tell me no Gopi Aarii said T am so confused. Then I heard her titter Whats so funny said. Raghav is pretending to be an air hostess life Tir m tray and everything she said greatly amused talk to you later I said. Okay but tell me which course to take she said her tone finally serious.Ask Raghav he is the better student w i iC rnon GopL Nonsense you iL Let us talk when you are alone said. Call me this time tomorrow. Okay bye Bye Aarii said. miss you said a second too late. I only got a click in response. I returned to my room where my dinner tiffin and the brochures awaited me I imagined Aarti at Raghavs place in peals of laughter jMy insides burnt. I picked up a brochure in disgust I took a blade from my shaving kit cut out the cover pictures of the T selected students and ripped them tosltredsBansal classes did not look like the small tuition centres run out of tiny apartments in Vararrasi It resembled an institute or a large corporate office I stood in the gigantic lobby wondering v. hat to do next Students and teachers strode about in a purposeful manner as if they were going to launch satellites in space. Like in many other coaching classes in Kota the students had uniforms to eliminate social inequality. You had rich kids from Delhi whose parents gave them more pocket money than my father earned in an entire yean On the other hand you had losers like me from Varanasi who had neither the cash nor the brains required to be here Equality in clothes didnt mean Bansal believed all students were equal A class system existed based on your chances of cracking the entrance exam. CHETAN BHAOATThe person at the admissions office took my form. High performer he quizzed i wondered how anyone could respond to such a question. Excuse me I f you have more than per cent aggregate in class Xil or if you have an A IEEE rank up to you get a thirty per cent discount the bespectacled gentleman at the counter explained to me. T have per cent. AEEE rank I said. Oh In that case you apply for fullrate programme the admission officer said. I didnt realise my AIEEE rank could directly translate into money Can I get a discount I said wondering if one could bargain here. Depends on how you do in our entrance exam the officer said and stamped my tbrm. He handed me a receipt cum admit card for the entrance exam. Do I have to studv for your entrance exam I said. What will you study in two days Anyway you dont look like a bright student going by your marks. My suggestion is to apply to other institutes he replied. Thanks I will I said. The officer looked around to ensure nobody could hear us. My cousin has just started an institute. can get you a fifty per cent discount there he whispered. I kept quiet He slipped me a visiting card DreamilTt Why waste money Course material is the same. My cousin is an exBaiisal faculty I examined the card. Don t tell anyone okay he said. had similar experiences at other institutes. Wails covered with stampsized pictures of successful J EE candidates resembling wanted terrorists greeted me everywhere. I also realised that the reputed institutes kicked up a bigger fuss about repeaters. After all we had failed once and institutes didnt want to spoil their statistics. Top institutes claimed to send up to five hundred students a year to IIT. Of course the institutesREVOMTIOM M M never reveal that they enrol ten thousand students out of which only live hundred make it This meant a low selection ratio of five per cent. However the JEE had an overall selection ratio of less than two per cent and Kota institutes claimed to beat It The prescreening of candidates could be the sole reason for the higherthanaverage selection However students like me flocked from around the country anyway and queued up to submit the admission forms. AimllT and Careerlgnite had less people lining up. In fact they gave me spot offers. The latter even offered a twenty per cent discount The discount is applicable only if you sign up right now not if you come again the aggressive salesmancumadmissions incharge told me. But have not decided yet I protested. You are appearing for Bansal a rent you he said and gave me an allknowing look I kept quiet. am an exBansalite he said Ts there anyone in Kota who is not I. said and left the institute.VjTopal So nice to hear your voice A art said. She recognised me in a second It felt good. Go to hell you dont care f said. Huh How stupid. I do care. Firstly do you have a mimherl can call Yes I said and gave her my landlords number But dont call a lot. He said no more than twice a week So what I will be the only one calling you no Aarti said. Yeah. Anyway hows life I hate it here I s it that bad Have you started studying she asked. No I cant. It is hard to pick up the same hooks again. Maybe I will gel motivated after I join a coaching class. I should have been there I would have motivated you She laughed. Dont make such jokes. You will be fine Gopi. One more attempt I f y o t i career will be made I miss you I said less interested in useless things like my career Xh she said somewhat surprised by my shifting gears. miss youTOO II have no one Aarti I said. Dont say that. Baba is there Raghav me . . . p p h j alqt Her voice trailed off. Why don f we become a couple Dont. Please dont start that again. We have dlscijsiedlt enough she said. Whynot You say you miss me. You careREVOLUTION I care far you a lot. But not in that way. Anyway we have to focus on our respective careers. You are there am here I f I had a girlfriend at least I could talk to her. I feel so lonely Aarti lildi Aww Gopl you are homesick. Talk to me whenever you want. Or we canch.ati Xn the Internet had seen some cyber cafes around my house Yeah make a Gmail ID. Mine is tlymgaarUgmailxom Invite me flying Aarti I laughed Shut up I laughed harder At least it cheered you up she said Think about my proposal I said There is no proposal And now dont waste your money on calls. We can chat in the evenings. Ill tell you about my life and you about yours. Okay Okay He listen. Should I jomatefmbedimte the upcoming but cheaper ones The best you can get always Aarti said promptly. And now bye. . hey are calling me for dinner.One week in Kota and I had a few decisions made for me. One I didnt clear the Bansal exam I could join their separate correspondence programme which kind of defeated the purpose of being in Rota. Resonance hiked its fees at the last minute It became unaffordable for me so I didnt even write their entrance exam f made it to the waitlist of the Career Path programme. Your chances are good. Many will join Bansal and Resonance anyway the Career Path guy said Even the Career Path waitlist had value. AimIT and Careerlgnite offered me a thirty per cent discount. You have calibre the AimllT person told me You have cleared Career Path which shows your potential. Now study with us at a much cheaper price and clear the exam CHETAN BHAGATcYouwill be lost amongst the thousands at Career Path At Ignite youwill be special said the exBansalite running down another exBansalites institute. However five days later Career Path told me I had made i t I handed the accountant at Career Path a twentythousandrupee draft with trembling hands. This is the best investment you will make in your life the accountant said I picked up the items required for the first term course material ID card timetable circulars and various worksheets required in the next three months. I also collected three sets of the Career Path uniform Wearing it made me look like a budget hotel receptionist. I walked out of the institute with the uniform in my hands Congratulations A man in a black coat stopped me. Hello I said not sure what else to say. T am Sanjeev sir. They call me Mr Pulley here I teach physics I shook his hand. Apparently nobody could solve pulley problems in Kota quite like Sanjeev sir. I soon realised there were subject experts across institutes in Kota. Career Path had its own wizards. Mr Verma who taught maths had the moniker of Trignometryswamy. Mr jadeja taught chemistry. Students affectionately addressed him as Balancejl He had a unique method of balancing chemical equations. According to rumours he had tried to patent it T am Gopal from Varanasi AEEE programme Mr Pulley said. TEE also sir. Good. High potential He referred to Career Paths internal classification of students. No sir said and trained my gase down. Once you get low marks you learn to lower your eyes rather quickly. Tts okay. Many nonhigh potential students make it It all depends on hard work Til do my best sir I said.Good Mr Pulley said and smacked my back.I could call myself a true Kotaite a month into moving there. Like thousands of other students my life now had a rhythm. Career Path resembled a school but without the fun bits. Nobody made noise in class played pranks on one another or thought of bunking classes. After all everyone had come here by choice and had paid a big price to be here. We had three to four classes a day which started in the afternoon. In theory this allowed the current class XiX students to attend school in the morning m reality the class XII students never went to school Career Path had an agreement with a cooperative CBSE school which had a flexible attendance policy. It was rumoured that the CBSE school received a handsome kickback from Career Path for the cooperation extended I hated the brutal Career Path schedule at first Lectures started at two in the afternoon and went on until nine in the evening. Alter that students rushed home to eat dinner and do the daily practice sheets a set often problems based on the current lesson. I usually finished by midnight. After a few hours of sleep t would wake up and prepare for the next days classes. In between I did household chores such as washing clothes and shopping for essentials. I went along with the madness not so much because of the zeal to prepare but more because I wanted to keep myself busy I didnt want Kotas loneliness to kill me. One night our classes ended late. reached the cyber cafe at ninethirty later than my usual chat time with Aarti. To my surprise she was still online. I typed in a message from my usual handle GopalKotaFactory Hi Flying Aarti Hey Guess what If girls got to set grammar rules in this worlds there would only be exclamation marks GopalKotaFactory What CBSBTAN BHAGATFlyingAarti fm at the BHU campus.

Not just give me a bland okay She didnt even ask me if I had had my dinner FlyingAarti Did you eat dinner GopalKotaPactory Not yet. Will do so when I get home. FlyingAarti Cool When girls are hiding something they start speaking like boys and use expressions like cool GopalKotaPactory How about you FlyingAarti Raghavs treating me. Only at his canteen though. ..Cheapo GopalKotaPactory You still seem excited She did not respond. If someone stalls you on a chat every minute seems like an hour. She finally typed after five long minutes. FlyingAarti What f tried the waiting game on lien However could not last more than ten seconds GopalKotaPactory Nothing FlyingAarti Okay anyway Raghavs here. He says hi. I have to quickly eat and head back home. Chat later then Xoxo . I didift know what xoxo implied file xs were supposed to be hugs and the os kisses. I don t think Aarti meant them. She logged out f had twenty minutes of Internet time left. I spent them doing what most guys who came here did surf the official IIT website or watch porn. I guess these are the two things boys wanted most in Kota At least the coaching centres could help you get one of themK J n the eve of Aarti s birthday I had finished three months in Kota For the first time I managed to reach the top twentyfive percentile in a class test. Balanceji congratulated me. My chemistry score had improved by twenty points. Mr Pulley didnt like my average physics performance Shishir sir also known as Permutation guru paused a few extra seconds by my seat as my maths score had improved by ten per cent kept my answersheet in my bag as sat for the physics class. I looked around the threehundredseat lecture room. Mr Pulley was speaking into a handheld mike tapping it every time he felt the class was not paying enough attention. I still had a long way to go. One needed to reach at least the topfive percentile in the Career Path class to feel confident about an IT seat. An I IT seat is not a joke Mr Pulley said even though nobody ever claimed it was. Increasing your percentile in a hypercompetitive class is not easy You have to live breathe and sleep HT. The top twenty students in every class test received royal treatment. They were called Gems a title still elusive to me Gems stood for Group of Extra Meritorious Students Gems comprised of ultrageeks whod prefer solving physics problems to having sex and for whom fun meant memorising the periodic table. Career Path handled Gems with care as they had the potential to crack the top hundred ranks of JEE and thus adorn future advertisements. Gems were treated preciously similar to how one would imagine Lux soap officials treat their brand ambassador Katrina KaifEEBUililONG I had not come close to being one of the Gems. However the top twentyfive percentile felt good. I wanted to share this with Aarti Also had told her Id be the first one to wish her on her birthday. reached the STD booth close to midnight. picked up the phone at J p.m. and dialled her number got a busy signal. I tried again but couldnt get through I made five attempts but the line was still engaged. Let other customers call the shopkeeper said Fortunately only one other person stood in line a student waiting to call his mother in Guwahati to wish her a happy birthday. I waited patiently as he ended his call at a.m. I rushed into the booth and called Aarti again The line came busy After several attempts the shopkeeper gave me looks of sympathy. He told me he had to shut his shop by a.m. I tried calling many more times at twominute intervals but to no avail I dont blow why but I decided to call Raghavs house. It being a Friday night I knew Raghav would be home for the weekend. I hesitated for a second before I dialled his number. Of course if the phone rang so late the whole house would be startled. However my suspicions were right. The line was busy I tried Raghavs and Aartis numbers in quick succession. could not get through to either. My good wishes for Aarti vanished as my excitement gave way to angeEike so iongiThe shopkeeper tapped my booth window The police will harass me if stay open any longer. To vou know where i can find an STD booth open I said. Railwaystation the shopkeeper said. He switched off the lit sign.No autorickshaw agreed to go to the railway station at a reasonable price at that hour. If I ran I could cover thefive kilometre distance in halfan hour..I reached platform of Kota station at a.m. panting after my livekilometre jog. Even at this hour the station was bustling. A train arrived and the generalquota passengers ran for seats. CRETAN BHAGATI found an STD booth and called Aarti. This time the phone rang. took a deep breath. My temper was not something I was proud o f f wanted to keep it under check as the birthday girl picked up the phone Hello DM Pradhan spoke instead. Hello uncle Uncle Gopal blurted out even though I should have probably hung up. After so many attempts I had to talk to her Oh yes. Hold om he said and screamed for Aarti Aarti came close to the phone. could hear her conversation with her father How much will you talk oo the phone Your friends keep calllng her father grumbled. . Tts my birthday dad Aarti said and picked up the phone. Happy birthday Aarti I said trying to sound excited. Hey Gopal Thanks Thai s so sweet of you. You stayed up solute to wish me she said. I also ran five kilometres and will walk back five more I wanted to say but didnt. Tve been trying to reach you for an hour Really Aarti sakL Yeah the line was busy. Who were you talking to I wanted to be the first said. Oh my cousins you know in the US I have my aunt there no Her voice sounded overtly casual Aarti forgot I had known her for eight years. I could sense it when she lied. They spoke longdistance for an hour What one hour I spoke to them for two minutes. Maybe I didnt place the phone back properly. Leave it no. How are you Wish you were here Do you Yeah. Of course I miss you Aarti said her tone so genuine that it was hard to believe she had lied to me ten seconds ago. I f you had placed the phone incorrectly who placed it back correctly now Gopal Stop interrogating me I hate this. Itmblilbday And you lie on your birthdayWhat Swear on our friendship that Raghav didnt call I said. What Aarti said her voice loud. Swear How old are we ten He called no You were speaking to him. Whats going on between ym guys Its my birthday. Can you not make it so stressful You havent answered my question Its late Dad is hovering around. Chat tomorrow on the net . Vtter my college have classes I said. Sunday Lets chat on Sunday around noon okay Aarti just be honest with me. I value honesty a lot I said Of course. Okay bye now. Dads giving me dirty looks. Honestly Bye i aid i walked back trying not to cry. Wait til Sunday consoled myselfShe never came online on Sunday I spent two hours at the cyber cafe. Noon became one and one became two Theres only so much porn one can watch. I downloaded enough xrated clips to open a video library f couldnt bear it anymore. How hard was it to deliver on a simple promise I had done nothing but wait for Sunday to talk things out with her She had suggested the time not . Wanted to vent my anger but had no outlet I kicked the CPU of the computer in frustration. The power went ofT What are you doing I h e owner of the cyber cafe came running. Sorry I have a temper problem. I am working on it I said and rushed out I went to the STD booth called her home. Her mother picked up Good afternoon aunty Gopal here. Hello Gopal Partis mother said curtly. Her husband might be the DM but she had more attitude fhw him CHETAN BHAUATAunty is Aarti around She left early morning with Raghav for KanpurJ Kanpur I said shocked. She had gone three hundred kilometres away from Varanasi with Raghav Yes some festival at IT Kanpur. Raghav is in the debating team. Shes also participating. Singing I think. Oka I said wondering what question to ask next to get more information. Anything important Aarti mother said. Hell it is importantt aunty. I want to know if your daughter is having a seme Nothing urgent. Theyll come back tonight right The roads are not afe.lsaid. Of course. Shes gone in the government car. With a security guards I wanted to post my own security guards next to Aarti. Thanks Aunty said. Okay. You study Then you can also be in a proper college and have fun like Raghav. Yes Aunty I said reaffirming my commitment to join a proper college before I hung up I checked my wallet I had only hundred bucks left of my selfassigned monthly allowance of a thousand bucks. The month of November still had ten days left. scolded myself for spending too much on calls. One moment I told myself not to chase her. Let her call or mail hack. However the next moment I could think of nothing but her. I had crazy mental conversations with myself. She couldnt be dating him She said she is not ready for a relationship. If she is she will go out with me Mr Optimist Gopal said. However Mr Pessimist Gopal did not buy it. Okay so Raghav has better looks. But Aarii is not so shallow. I have known her for a decade Mr Optimistme argued. Raghav also has better future prospects Mr Pessimistme said But would she choose a guy just on the basis of his JEE rank She is a girl not a damn institute said Mr Optimistme.LLIXTITO She finch him funny Mr Pessimist said.She will even find jokers in the circus funny Mr Optimist said.My head hurt as the two morons inside would not stop arguing Girls have no idea what effect their wavering has on boys. I had to talk to Aarti. I wanted to shake her and make her talk. My temper flared again. I wanted to run to the Kota station and travel unreserved to VaranasL I couldht think about Balanceji or my percentile or the stupid Career Path.If Raghav did anything with Aarti I would fucking kill him.t pressed the doorbell six times when I reached home. Everything okay uncle said. Tm not going to fucking kill myself okay Shouting helped release tension What he said shocked by my language. Sorry I said. You dont use fwords with your landlord. I didnt sleep the whole night kicked myself for thinkiogabout her so much She is a liar ditcher and heartless person I told myself fifty times. She also happened to be someone I couldnt stop thinking about. Love officially is nothing but a bitch.V V e had a surprise test in class the next day which went badly. In the chemistry class Balancedi scolded me as could not answer even a simple question. I didnt give a fuck wanted to get hold of this girl. ran to a cyber cafe after class. She wasnt online. I did not know what to do. It would be way too desperate to call her again. I had a horrible week at Career Path. My results slipped to the eightieth percentile. Fourfifths of the class had done better than me Career Path had a software that picked out students with the maximum improvement or deterioration featured in the latter. This is not acceptable Shishir sir Permutation guru and partner in Career Path said. T m sorry sirM said You are not in bad company hope T have no friends. There is no company I said truthfully Get some then Shishir sir said You need some friends in Kota to cope I looked at Shishir sir. He seemed young and genuine T know how hard it is. I am a Kota product myself On Sunday I went to the cyber cafe again. As usual no email. However she came online in five minutes A part of me resisted. I initiated the chat anyway GopalKotaFactory Hi.

GopalKotaPactory Ym sorry did that if ay. f also wanted to add that she ditched rue last Sunday on chat. I wanted to ask why she went to Kanpur with Raghav. However if I came on too strongly she would give me the silent treatment that could kill me. First and foremost I had to get information out of hen GopalKotaPactory You know my temper problem. am working on it FlyingAarti Its fine Apology accepted. I found it strange that ended up saying sorry when she owed me an apology Is it ever the girls fault The good thing about chatting on the internet is that you can control your impulses took a couple of deep breaths and typed something neutral. GopalKotaPactory So whats up When in doubt stick to openended questions. HyingAaili Not much. College is busy. Made some friends. Not many.

GopalKotaPactory Can you tell me why Because he has a JEE FlyingAarti Shut up Gopal. Its a very special bond between him and me. GopalKotaPactory Really What makes it special Did you give him a blow job Where In his hostel or in Kanpur She didnt respond I realised had said too much. However you cannot undo a line sent on chaL And did not want to fucking apologise again I kept waiting for an answer. After three minutes a message flashed on my screen FlyingAarti is otilioe. I refreshed my screen. I had another notification FlyingAarti is no longer a contact. She had removed me from her list. Ton need to extend your time the cafe owner asked me. No that wont be necessary not for a long time I said. C H ETA N B HAG AT Hie day Aarti cut off contact with me was the day I stopped doing my daily practice sheets I no longer went to the cyber caf either. Instead I hung out every night at the roadside Chaman chai shop near my house. Students teacups in one hand and worksheets in another occupied the one dozen wooden benches I didnt bring any reading material to the shop. sat there killing hours watching the crowd and nursing cups of tea. One day I ran out of money to pay for my order. an sorry said to Chaman the shopowner will bring the cash tomorrowSomeone I didnt know stepped forward and handed the shopkeeper ten bucks. Chill the newcomer said to me Oh thanks said. Barisal he said as he collected the change. Career Path I. said. Ill pay you tomorrow forgot my wallet at home Relax he said and extended his hand. Tin Prateek. From Raipur His stubbled face made him look more like an artist than an IIT aspirant Repeater Prateek said. I nodded. Quitter he said. Whats that Tried Kota. Didnt work. Still hanging around here to get some .peace I laughed. had AIEEE . I think I may have a chance if I try again Do you want to Prateek said. kept quiet. We sat down on the wooden stools outside the shop. You look like you are on the verge of becoming a quitter he said. m tine A little low. The next installment at Career Path is due. My father doesnt have much cash on him Go back Prateek said. He lit a cigarette and.rrif toine. I declined. T cant. All his hopes axe pinned on me Hell borrow money and send itREVOLUTION Prateck dropped his head back and blew smoke towards the sky I had reached the top twentylive percentile I said to justify my existence in this place. Had reached You are still doing the course right slipped in the past few weeks Why Nothing I sipped my tea Prateek drained his cup and ordered another. I s it a girl he said dont even know you pay you your ten bucks. Stop probing I ssidL Chill man I am only making conversation. He laughed and patted iwhouiderI kept quiet Images of countless boat rides with Aarti passed through my mind. How I rowed with my bare hands. How she used to massage my palms afterwards . . . I flexed my hands rememberingi hate hen Bui I miss herPrateek smoked two cigarettes without uttering a word. I t is a girl said grudgingly Left you He grinned. Never came to me. Happens. We are losers. We dont get things easily. Marks ranks girls nothing is easy for usJ Yeah everyone takes us for a ride. From Kota classes to the bitch back home I said. Bitch eh You seem like a fun guy Prateek highfived me. better go homevWedont have a home We are like people stuck in outer space. Nohome no school no college no job. Only Kota He winked at me. Prateek studied at Resonance as a secondtime repeater. Pie had become a quitter the first time and even now he had almost given up. We became friends meeting at Chamans every night. One day the tea didnt seem enough. Mr Pulley had thrown me outof his class. CHETAN BHAGATSo what if he asked you to leave. Its not like a real college Prateek said. T fell asleep. Such a boring lecture said. He laughed T gave them their bloody second installment today. Still they do this to me I said. Chill we need more than tea today Prateek stood up. We walked out of the tea shop Where are we going My place he said.Prateeks room didnt look like that of a hardworking repeater in Kota. Beer bottles outnumbered books cigarette butts exceeded pens. The walls had posters of scantilyclad women instead of Resonance circulars Youve really settled down here I said I would if I could My parents wont fund me here after this year he said. He took out a bottle of Old Monk from his cupboard. He poured the rum neat for me. It tasted terrible. What happens alter this year I said. Nothing. Reality check for my parents. Both of them are teachers. Hopefully the passing of two years and half their life savings will make them realise that their son cant crack any entrance exam. You can if you work hard I said and kept my drink aside. No I cant Prateek said his voice firm. The selection rate is less than three per cent. Most of us cant crack these tests basic probability But who will drill it into our parents heads Anyway finish your drink in one shot The rum tasted like some hot and bitter medicine. I forced it down my throat. I had to get over Aarti. Sometimes the only way to get rid of an unpleasant feeling is to replace it with another unpleasant feeling. I asked for another drink and then another. Soon Aarti didnt seem so painful You loved her Prateek said.Rfc DLL riON t What is love Love is what your parents give you if you clear the HT exam hesaidWe highfived. did I guess J said after a while. How long He lit a cigarette Eight years Holy shit Did you guys meet at birth in the hospital Prateek said. shook my head. Over the next three hours told him my entire onesided love story. From the day had stolen her tiffin to the day she massaged my hand for the last time and until she finally logged out and removed me as a contact Prateek listened in silence. So what do you think Say something I said. To my surprise he was still awake.Toy can talk a lot man He poured out the remaining rum for me. Sorry said sheepishly Did bore you I t s okay. Try to forget her. Wish her happiness with her JEE boy. cant forget her. I havent studied a day since she stopped talking tome Dont worry. You will get another girl Everybody gets a girl Even the last rankers. How do you think India has such a large population Til never marry I said. Then what Marry your hand Prateek burst out laughing. Men are useless. They hide their inability to discuss relationships behind lame jokes T better gov I said. He didnt stop me. He lay on the floor too tired to go to his bed. Dont lose your grip man he shouted after me as I left his house. Grip Yes thats the word. The trick to these entrance exams is that you have to get a grip on them. You need a game plan What are your strong subjects which are your weak ones Are you working with the teachers on the weak areas Are you tracking your progress on the mocktests Are you thinking about nothing but the exam all day Do you eat your meals and lake your bath as fast as possible so that you have more time CHETAN B HAG ATto study If your answer is yes to all these questions thats when you can say you have a grip. Thats the only way to have a shot at a seat Of course you could be one of those naturally talented students who never have to study much. But most of us are not courtesy our parents mediocre genes. Ironically these same parents who donated these dumb genes take the longest time to understand that their child is not Einsteins clone. had lost my grip. At least for the three months after Aarti cut me off The spacedout Prateek became my new and only friend. I attended classes though my hangover made it difficult to understand Benzene structures or radioactive isotopes. I tried to do my practice sheets but could not focus. The teachers started to see me as a quitter and stopped paying attention to me. became a suckerstudent one of the nohope kids who are only kept around because they paid the coaching centre. I had another problem to deal with. My expenses had increased for I had to pay for rum. Prateek treated me a few times but after a while he asked me to pay my share I knew Baba had borrowed to pay the last installment and had no money. However I had little choice. I dialled home from the STD booth one night. Sorry I didnt call last week Baba I said. Its okay You are studying hand Baba said his voice very weak. Baba there is a little problem I said WlMff T need some new books. They are supposed to be the best for maths. Cant you borrow them from someone Hard to said. Everyone wants to keep theirs Baba paused. I kept quiet trying to recuperate from uttering so many lies at once How much Two thousand. They are imported Okay. Do you have the money Baba Can I send it in a week How much loan did you take Baba I said.ttELOT.rOlf S Fifty thousand he said sent you thirty hut needed some extra to repair the roof What about your medical bills owe twenty thousand to the hospital You will anyway borrow more right Probably Send whatever you can will go now it is an expensive call I said wanting to end the ordeal as soon as possible You will get selected no GopifYesyes willI kept the receiver down i fell terrible. I resolved to study harder. Jwill get back into the twentyfive percentile and then the top five percentile.I decided to study the entire night. However I bad a craving for rum first. My resolve weakened. I went to Prateeks house and spent most of the night there Nothing could motivate me to study. Then came my y birthday came five months after my arrival in Kota. i did not think of it as a special day and planned to attend classes as usual However late night on my birthday eve Mr Soni knocked on my door. Someone on the phone asking for you He sounded drowsy Who is it said surprised. Baba A girl Mr Soni said. And happy birthday by the way Thanks said and picked up the phone. Who could it be I thought. A teacher from Career Path Did do something wrong Happy birthday Gopai Aartis wonderful words fell like raindrops on a hot Kota afternoon. Emotions surged within me. I felt overwhelmed Aarti said. Uncontrollable tears ran down my cheeks. So you still recognise my voice I thought Ill play a guessing game Can we talk Or am disturbing you had played out this scene of speaking with Aarti a million times in my head I thought I would be curt with her if she ever called me. Like I didnt care who she was. Or I would pretend to be busy. Of course all those mental dress rehearsals flew out of the window eNo no Aarti I said. You are not disturbing me at all. I had not felt better in months. Why did birthdays come only once a year So doing anything special on your birthday Aarti said. Not really. Will go out for dinner with a friend Friend Date eh she said in her trademark naughty voice Prateek. its a guy I said. Oh okay Aarti said. Thats nice T am sorry about the chat the last timeIMvm timm zom She kept quiet shouldnt have said those things. But you cut off contact Nobody has ever spoken to me like that Imorryf MSI t s okay An w a y its your birthday. I dont want you to feel horrible. Hows Raghav I said unable to control myself. More than anything wanted to know their relationship status. Hes great. Finished his first semester at BHU Must be mugging away No not that much. In fact he edits the campus magazine now. Keeps talking about that. thats great I said. She still hadnt told me about both of them. I did not want to pry too much like the last time Ties a great guy Gopal You should see him how much he wants to do for the world. I did not mind Raghav doing whatever he wanted for the world as long as he left one person in the world alone. . never said he is a bad person I said. Good. And I am happy with him. If you care for me as a friendyou should accept that Are we friends I asked. T wouldnt be talking to you otherwise right she said. I wanted to tell her she hadnt spoken to me for three months. However girls get extremely upset if you give them evidence contrary to their belie Yes guess I said and paused before I spoke again. So wte can talk Yeah as long as you dont make me leel imeomfbrtable. Ai And what Accept Raghav and me Do have a choice I said Thats the point want you to accept ithpily will be you if you find the girl of your dreams CHETAN BHAGATSo thats it Raghav is the man of her dreams.The rusty knife returned to my gut. I wondered what to say. do accept said after a while. More than anything I didnt want to lose touch with her again. My life in Kota had become hell after she disappeared. Cool. Because I miss you she said as a friend She emphasised the last qualifier Girls always leave subtle phrases as qualifiers so you cant put them in a spot later. Like if I told her but you said you missed me she would jump and say but I also said as a friend as if we were in a court of justice It is so hard to figure girls out could bet even the Career Path Gems could not do it Tou there she said interrupting my chain of thought. Yeah. I.saidc OkayI have to go. Happy birthday againThank you bye. Will speak to you or c h a t I said and paused. T will add you back on chat she laughed. Sorry again said. Doivt be stupid birthday boy If you were here Id pull your cheeks she said. Thats it. She had done it again confuse me with a throwaway affectionate line. Did she like me or not Oh well Raghav is her man reminded mvself Chat soon she said and hung up I felt so good that even the physics solutions guide on my desk looked kissable. I wanted to study I wanted to live.Career Path would never know why made it to the mostimproved list once again Aarti had me go back to studies in a big way. Maybe it was her simple how was your day in our chats. I also liked to be accountable to her and report back to her on how productive the day had been. I told her about the equations taught in class the feedback the teacher gave me especially the praise and how I planned to study late into the nightDeep down I still wanted to impress hen never gave up the idea of fur having a change of heart. Mr Optknistme never gave up.Maybe she will tell me on chat today how things arent working out with Raghav or how she connects with me so much better than with her ktyfrimdHowever she never said such things even though sometimes she came close Once she told me Raghav was a stubborn pest She said it after lLvah r i JKI diuhed her for a movie date twice because of a publication deadline for his college magazine I couldnt imagine any man slipping a dunce to be with Aarti I could skip my Career Path mocklest let alone a stupid deadline for a stupid magazine. However I didnt tell her this. I knew mv place I who could never compare myself to Raghav I chatted with her one evening and talked about my class performance GopaiKotaFactory So reached th..

FlyingAarti Two more months then we can all have lots of fun. GopalKotaFactory Yeah. Thanks. FlyingAarti Bye. Xoxoxo And FlyingAarti logged out. I walked back home as slowly as possible. After all I had nothing to look forward to but books. tried not to imagine both of them in a theatre hand in hand. I debated if I should be in touch with Aarti at all. However I remembered the abyss I had fallen into the last time. A few jabs at the heart are better than a complete nervous breakdown.The Career Path instructors toici us to go to sleep at pm the night before the JEE exam. In our last class we had motivational speeches. Balanceji gave examples of people ranging from Mahatma Gandhi to Muhammad Ali people who never gave up and won against ail odds. I pumped my fist like Ali and charged out of the institute like Gandhi to crack one of the toughest entrance exams in the world On my way home I called the two people who I thought may want to wish me luck My best wishes are always with you my GopL Tomorrow is your chance to make your family name famous Baba said hank you. Baba f said ping ihe short. dialled Aartr number next T fdlo a male voice surprised me. It did not May speak to Aarti please I said whos this the v. Hi Gopal Ifs Raghav the voice said. almost dropped the phone Raghav said I had not spoken to in almost a year. You dont keep in touch Gopal Though its my fault too Raghav said. didnt know how much Raghav knew about Aarti and me in particular about our showdown and the subsequent resumption of communication. I kept to a neutral tone and topic. Hows BHUT So far so good. Its like any other college. Jus better facilities. HowT know My college is a centre too. You didnt come here to take it T have classes initil the last minute. Plus my AIEEE final refresher Glad I am done with all that man Raghav laughed. Not unkindly I winced. When someone refers to your weak spot even indirectly it Me too hopefully soon J wid. Youll crack it. Aarti tells me you are doing wed CHETAN BHAGATSo they do talk about me I thought Who knows Depends on the paper. So much of it is luck TrueRaghav said We had an awkward nothingtosay moment It was his fault as he forgot I had called for Aarti. So is Aarti around Oh yes hold on a second. heard her giggle. I wondered if Raghav had joked about me. Hey Best of luck JEE boy Aarti said. Thank you. Need it I went to the Vishwanath TerapIeAri You did Yes. I dragged this lazy Raghav to take a bath and come along too she said and laughed again. We just came back ... Hey Raghav stop ... stop ... Hold on GopaL I paid longdistance to hear their private banter I heard Aarti tell Raghav to stop imitating hen But Raghav didnt seem to have anything better to do. Hello I said after sixty seconds. Hey sorry Aarti said as she composed herself Okay now I have managed to turn away from him. Gopi you will go into the exam centre superconfident promise Yes said like an obedient child. I liked her maternal instinct with me want you. to feel that you can get whatever you want in life Because i know you can Aarti said. cannot get you I wanted to tell her. Still I appreciated her boosting me up for the big test AIEEE ends and I am on a train in the next four hottrsf Yes we are waiting too. Come back soon. When the results come out we will celebrate your victory together. Only if I get in I said. Do not think like that Believe you have already inade If Aarti s a f tREVOLUTION Her las htr siktise meant the world to me. Yes i wanted to make it forThe city had changed but the JEE exam centre in Kota gave me the same feeling as last year Parents came by taxiloads and auto loads. Some rich kids came in airconditioned cars. Mothers performed little pujas and rituals for their children ironically right before they went in to show their mastery of science. I did not have anyone from my family fussing over me. f Mt care Tikks on the heads and curd in the mouth didnt matter.. Once you went inside you had to fcai c be hell out of the ninetynine per cent of the half a million students sitting for the exam across the country. I had a good start I solved the first few problems with relative ease The middle became tough. Some questions belonged to chapters taught during my drunken and depressed phase in Kota. got stuck on one problem. I thought I could solve it became possessed and wasted ten minutes suppose I have a problem letting go Ten minutes are crucial in the EE. I mentally kicked myself and moved on to the next problem. I went on solving as many problems as I could before the dreaded bell rang. The examiner snatched my paper away even as I begged him to let me write one last answer Leaving that one question could cost me five hundred ranks but... the JEE had ended How did it go Baba asked me in the evening. I tried to be as honest as possible. Better than last time Good. But dont relax. Give your foil attention to A IEEE. T will I said Aarti and I chatted briefly. She predictably reassured me about things. She had term break in her college. Her parents had planned a family trip to the USA to visit her aimt. Even if I cannot call or chat will email you from Chicago she said. She did send nie a couple of mails wishing me luck for the AIEEE exam. Aarti also wrote to me that Raghav had his vacation and was interning at a local newspaper. CHETAN BHAGATSo Raghavs dad is not too happy about his engineertobe son at the newspaper I say what is wrong with it Aarti wrote in one of her emails As people took international holidays and indulged their passions took the A IEEE. It went off smoothly much better than the previous time. However it is a speedbased test. You cant really tell if you did well as compared to others. One is lucky to be able to attempt seventy per cent of the questions. felt I had a much better shot than last time. In any case I submitted my answersheet and ran home to pack. I had a train to catch f had served my Kota sentence Prateek came to drop me at the station. He helped me place my heavy bags in the compartment.Whenare you going back to Raipur said.Whenever they come fetch me Prateek said cheekily and wavedYaranasif JLfL nly the sights and smells of Varanasi caine to receive me at the station. hadnt told anyone aixH.il my arrival hadnt warred Bcba to waste money on an autorclf haw to the station. Hed told me that the loans and interest we owed totalled one and a half lakhs. Loan sharks continued to charge interest at Ifiree per cent a month. Tou join a good college and the State Sank of India will give us a cheaper loan Baba had told me. Even the filthy ami crowded streets of Gadholia seemed beautiful to me. No place like your hometown. More shan anything wanted to meet Aarti. Every inch of Varanasi reminded me of hen People come to mycity io foci the presence of i.d but f could feci her presence everywhere.SHowever had to go to Baba first. I rang the doorh J l at home. XJopal Baba exclaimed hugging me with his weak arms missed Varanasi Baba. I missed home. missed you. fhe house aptered messier rhan before. suppose Baba could only dam it so much I picked up a broom to sweep the floor Q top it you have come after a year. What are you doing Baba snatched the broom from me. We ate rum vvdow dal and dry chapatis for lunch. Homecooked food felt delicious My father had not spoken to anyone in a long time so he iked with his mouth foil Hie case is going nowhere. Ghanshvam wont even show up for the hearing. I think lie feels will die soon It will be easier to resolve ftei wards anyway he said.What are you talking about Baba CHETAN BHAGATHesright. How much can my lungs take He had a coughingfitevenas he said this Nothing will happen to you. Let me speak to the lawyer.Nouse. I have no money to pay him He doesnt take my callsanymore. Forget about all this. When is your entrance result In one month I said absentmindedly trying to decide if should call Aarti first or wash my hands. I dialled her number with dalsmeared fingers Hello she said Boat ride this evening madam I said Gopal You are back When did you come An hour ago When do we meet I said. This evening at the ghats Yes sure oh wait. No have to go to Raghavs college You are welcome to come along No thanks Why not He is your friend too T want to catch up with you first. We will catch up on the way. Ill send dads car. Come okay I had little choice. I didnt want to wait another day to see her. Raghav wont mindHe will be thrilled itsEvent. will tell you when we meet. Wow almost a year right Three hundred and five days I said Someones returned a geek. See you.Theres a sense of power when you sit in a white government Ambassador car with a red light on top. Traffic eases policemen salute you for no reason and you start to wonder if civil services are where you should be. The car took me to the DMs bungalow. Located in the posh Cantonment area the twoacre property had a serpentinedriver. Tell Aarti madam am waiting in the car I told the driveway.REVOLUTION I did not want to discuss Kota and the upcoming entrance exam results with her parents. Her pink salwarkameez became visible at a distance. As she came closer saw her face no makeup apart from the lipgloss. I had not seen anything more beautiful in three hundred and five days I controlled my excitement as she opened the car door Hi Aarti I said Why so formal Come here Aarti said and hugged me Her sequined dupatta poked me in the chest while her scent went to my head Raghav s college she aki to the driver and fie understood. So hows life Arent you glad to be krsmtly. Unless it is for IIT she said and mnkt d at we I couldnt respond. What You will leave for an IFF right I collected myself I t s not like I have anything in hand Anyway whats Raghavs event l i e s revamped the college magazine Today is the launch of the new issueTs he even doing his BTech I only hear about his magazine. Aarti laughed. God I had missed that laugh. wanted to record it and play it on a loop. Tie is she said and grinned again. Though I also call him the fake enginem How did his newspaper internship go Not bad. They didnt let him write much though. They found his articles she searched tor the right words Too radical and different. We drove into the sprawling RHU campus. Manicured lawns and wellkept buildings made it look like another country compared to the rest of Varanasi XJ hall Aarti instructed her driver. We entered the fivehundredseater auditorium packed to capacity. A huge banner of the new magazine cover flapped across the stage.I t s my happiest day ever. I hope I never leave Varanasi again I saidback sheold. CHETAN BHAGATRaghav had changed everything layout look content and even the title. The cover read BHUkamp or earthquake. I noticed the smart utilisation of the university acronym. The magazines tagline said Shake the world Aarti and sat in the second row. The lights dimmed and music filled the hall. The crowd roared in anticipation. Raghav s backstage Aarti told me. Too many loose threads to tie up. Hell meet.us later A group often students took the stage. They were covered head to toe in black tights with skeletons painted on them. Ultraviolet lights came on and the skeletons glowed Michael Jacksons Man in the Mirror filled the auditorium m gonna make a change for once in my lifeThe crowd roared in excitement as the skeletons performed an acrobatic dance. Hie song continuedIf you wanna make the world a better place Take a look at yourself and then make a changeI s this a magazine launch or a dance show sniggered. Entertain them first grab their attention and then say what you want to say Aarti said. fuh i I looked at her. Her lace was bathed in the ultraviolet fight. Thats what Raghav says entertain and change f shrugged my shoulders. I turned around to look at the crowd. I wondered how many of them had spent time in Kota. Statistically speaking a third of them had come from the dry Td just left behind. I couldnt help thinking of all these seats in the hall could I not get The skeletons finished their act. The crowd broke into applause A tall man in a black suit came on stage. Good evening BHU his familiar voice filled the hall. Tts Raghav I said stunned by the transformation. I had never seen him in a suit. He looked like a rockstar. His toned body meant he madeREVOLUTION good me of the college sports facilities. In comparison I felt fat and old after a year in Kota. Raghav began his speech. This is not an ordinary college. You are no ordinary students We cannot have an ordinary magazine. Ladies and gentlemen I presentBHUkamprThe vpotight fed on the magazine cover. The aowxl cheered. Aarti clapped f . her eyes fixed u blinkunly on the stage The world has changed. Our college our city our country need to change too Raghav continued ho h going to change them Wc are. It rarts here We will shake the wood The crowd cheered again more at he enthusiasm in Raghavs voice than his words. Raghav s editorial team of students started to chant Bhukamp Bhukamp on ihe stage. The crowd picked up the chant We wiV print what nobody has the guts to print Issues that affect us. No bullshit Raghav said. The editorial team stepped off the stage and started distributing copies of the magazine. Raghav coathikl his ch. Our first cover story is about the state of our hostel kitchens. Our secrci team went and took pictures. Have a look at how your food is pteparcd I flipped the pages of BHUkamp There were pictures of cockroaches on the kitchen floor flies feasting mi thai and mess workers kneading dough with their feet. A collective wave of disgust ran through the crowd EwwAarti said as she saw flv pictures T am never eating in BHUagain BHUkamp will change our college for the better. These pictures have been sent to the director Raghav said. But dont think BHUkamp from dating to making of resumes Happy reading. Long live B H U f The crowds applause continued for a minute after he left the stage.is onlyserious stuff We have loads of jokes storks and poetry. We eve have tips CHHTAN BHAGATRaghav poshed a stainless steel plate with two slices of bread towards Aarti Butter toast. It is clean promise he said to her We had come to the RHU college canteen postevent. Aarti held the sandwich gingerly. Canteen is fine. Its the hostel kitchens that had a problem Raghav said. And they will clean it up after the issue. Eat Gopal I had ordered a plain paratha I nibbled at it. Raghav picked up Aarti sandwich and fed her. She smiled I burned. What did you think of Kota Raghav asked me. We have tons of people from there I f I get into a good college Kota is great If iiotv thewori You will be fine. You almost made it last year. Raghav tore his masaia dosa with his right hand In his left hand was a copy of BHUkamp. Youve changed Raghav I said. How He looked up. This magazine and stuff Why Why I like it thats why he said. Aarti didnt speak. She merely watched us talk. I wondered what went through her head. Did she compare us Well I did not match up to Raghav.Except in the amount I loved hen No man could love her like I did.You dont conic to a professional engineering college to edit magazines. People work their ass off here to get a good job said. Thats such a narrowminded view. And what about the things around us The food being cooked in an unhygienic manner. Labs with outdated machines. Look at our city. Why is Varanasi so dirty Who is going to clean our rivers Raghavs black eyes were feverish. Not us I retorted. Sorting out our own life is hard enough. Raghav picked up his spoon and pointed it at me. Thats the attitude he said that Fm here to change. Oh fuck o f f I said. Nobody can change anything. Hostel workers are not going to cook like your mother. And Varanasi has been the worlds dumping ground tor thousands of years. Everyone comes here to dumpREVOLUTION their sins. Does anyone give a fuck about us residents the people who deal with all the crap left behind Boys can we not be so serious fm bored said Aarti. am j u s t said. Tie wont listen. He is Mr Stubborn Aarti said and tweaked Raghavs nose. A shiver ran through me. Raghav extended his hand and Aarti held it. She stood up and went to sit on his lap Raghav became selfconscious as heads turned towards us. Engineering colleges dont witness public displays of affection People in love sometimes dont realise how stupid they look to the world Stop it Aarti Raghav said shifting her off his lap What are you doing Pouting she went back to her seat. Mr Editor dont edit me out of your life okay she said. I felt like a voyeur sitting there. This was not how I wanted to meet Aarti. I wanted to run away Should we leave said to Aarti. Sure I have to be home before ten We finished our dinner and Raghav settled the bill Hows Baba Raghav asked me. Sick said. Worse since J left. I suspect hes hiding something What Aarti said. Tie needs an operation but will not admit it. Hes trying to avoid more expense Thats ridiculous Raghav said. Yes we had an offer to sell the disputed land years aga Even at the throws way price we would have covered expenses Its your land. Why should you sell it cheap Raghav saidcBabawill be happy to hear you I said.The driver started the car as he saw us approach The headlights lit up the parking lot Get into the car Gopal be back in a second Aarti said. I waited in the cat Though I vowed not to look out I couldnt help but take a peek. Through the tinted glass I saw both of them walk behind.C U B TAN BHAGATa tree They embraced. Raghav lowered his head as he brought his face close to hers I thought I would vomit. She was back in five minutes. Did take too long she asked gaily. I kept quiet I didnt make eye contact. She signalled the driver to leave Nice evening no Aarti said. I nodded. Tsnt the campus beautiful she said as we left the BHU gates. We sat in silence. The car stereo played music A Kailash Kher song about a bird with broken wings that would never fly again played in the car The song talked about dreams being broken to pieces and yet urged the listener to smile in gods name. I glanced at her face sideways a couple of times. Her lipgloss had vanished. Despite my best efforts not to I couldnt but imagine them in more intimate situations. You okay Aarti said. Huh Yeah why said Why so quiet Thinking about Baba She gave me an understanding nod. But she could never understand that losers even if they do not have a brain have a heart.V eeks passed and the day of the results came closer. Baba seemed even more anxious than me. One night when I went to give him his medicines lie astedj. When are the results Next week L said.inrA week after that I said. I f ITT happens it will be amazing no Baba said his eyes bright I covered him with a blanket Baba did the doctor say you need an operation Doctors want more business these days what eke he said Should we ask Ghanshyam tayafi to give us whatever he wants foi the land I said. No use. He wont listen. Anyway what will I do with an operation at Igef Ton never listen Baba I shook my head and switched off the light.I t isnt the end of the world Gopal It isnt She reached out for my hand. Say something Aarti had invited me home on the day of the AfEEE results. She had an Internet connection and despite my insisting otherwise didnt want me to see the results all on my own. remember everything about that moment. The red and black embroidered tablecloth on the computer table the noisy fan above the various government trophies that belonged to her father the black colour of the laptop and the screen that showed my rank. CHETAN BIIAQAT it said irrevocably next to my roil number. After one whole year of cramming courses that hated staying in a dusty city all alone and putting my father irretrievably in debt I had only reconfirmed l a m a failure I dldnt react. I didnt cry I didnt feel anger fear frustration anything. I remember Aarti hovering around talking to me. However I couldnt really comprehend her words I stood up like a zombie Are you okay Aarti shook me. She me the PC the world everything seemed to be in slow motion. What about JEE she was saying. Will be worse. My paper did not go well She fell silent. What could she have said anyway I have to go I said. Where will you go she said asking me the most important question. Yes where could I go Home And tell Baba he had wasted all his borrowed money on me. Ill come home with you can talk to Baba I shook my head. Are you sure she said. I didnt respond I couldnt I hurried out of her house.Where had you gone Baba said as he opened the door. I went straight to my room. Baba followed me. You dont want to see your AEEE result he said. You said it comes out today I dldnt respond. Why arent you speaking I looked into Babas anxious eyes. have bad news I said. Baba spoke in a hushed voice. What The worst has happened.REVOLUTION I shrugged my shoulders. When are the AIBEE results out They are out said and walked into the living room. And Baba followed me and stood right in front of me. turned my gaze down. Baba waited for a few seconds. Slap I felt my right cheek sting. For his age and strength my father could strike quite a blow He had hit me for the first time in more than ten years. I deserved it How Baba said. You did nothing in Kota right Nothing. Tears filled my eyes and my ears buzzed. I wanted to tell him that I spent nights doing assignments sat through classes all day improved my percentile. I had had a decent chance to make it. A few marks are all it takes to fall behind ten thousand ranks. I didnt say anything I cried like a child as if my remorse would make him feel better. How do we return the money Baba said turning to practical matters faster than I thought. I had improved my rank I wanted to tell him The teachers at Career Path had told me I had potential Yes i did get distracted for a little while and maybe that was why I hadnt made it Anyway not everyone in Kota had made it. Most students of Career Path had not made it. In fact Vineet the boy from Varanasi who went before me to Kota hadnt made it either. But all showed Baba was my sullen face. What are you thinking Do you have any shame he said and went into a coughing fit. His body shook he found it hard to balance. Sit down Baba said as I moved forward to hold him. His body feltwmmDont come near me He pushed me away. You have fever I said. Guess who gave it he said. I didnt know what to say or do. I didnt even find myself worthy enough to fetch his medicines from the other room. I had to let him be. When you screw up someones life the least you can do is leave the person alone. CHHTAN BHAGAT have gone through it all You must be so fucked Vineet said to me We sat on the steps of Am Ghat close to the pier I had arranged a secret meeting with Vineet did not know him too well I had only exchanged some emails with him before left for Kota. But he seemed an ideal companion right now. Yes Aarti kept in touch asking me about my wellbeing and even going on boat rides with me. Yet I had nothing to say to her. I thought about jumping into the Ganga and ending my life Raghav was someone avoided automatically now did not want reassurance from an ITBHU guy especially someone who did not even seem to care about his degree. Vineet an ordinary guy like me was someone I felt comfortable with. B e had joined a private engineering college. So I can tell people I am doing BTech Vineet said and laughed. Just avoid the college name. Anyway it is unknown to most people. I collected a few pebbles from the ghat steps and sent them skipping on the holy river. You will be fine dude Vineet said. Never completely fine but at least better than right now How did you choose among the private colleges I said. There were dozens of them with new ones opening every week. went to a career fair. I asked around. RSTC seemed slightly better than others. I dont think theres much difference. Whats RSTC I said. Tliddhi Siddhi Technical College. The owners have a sari business with the same name. Oh I said trying to make a connection between sans and education Quite a backward name no So we say RSTC sounds cooler Vineet grinned. Do you get a job afterwards Tf you are lucky. Sixty per cent placements. Not bad Forty per cent students dont get placed I said shocked. This could be worse than Kota to finish your degree and get nothing at the end ofilREVOLUTION . The stats are improving every year Plus you can manage some job There are call centres credit card sales. Be openminded and things work ntf Finish engineering and join a call centre Dude don t be so shocked. We like millions of other students are the losers in the Great Indian Education Race Be happy with whatever you get Of course if your parents are rich do an MBA after BTeeh Another shot at a job And if not I said Vineet said nothing. Exasperated threw all the pebbles into the Ganga Like lowranked students the stones sank and disappeared without a trace. ley dont be mad at me didnt make the system. Vineet patted my shoulder. The longer you sit idle the worse you will feel. The dream is over. loin a college any college at least you will be with other students Other losers I said. Dont look down upon your own kind Vineet said. He find a point. T am sorry said How much does your BTech One lakh a year for four years including hostel Fuck I said Thats many years of salary a job would pay if there is a job at the end of it know. But your parents pay the fee. And they get to brag to everyone their son is becoming an engineer. You are free for the next four years. Think about it not a bad trade.kWehave no money I said flatly.Vineet stood up. That my friend is going to be an issue Leaving I said. Yeah campus is twenty kilometres out of Varanasl Cheer up. You have seen life at its most fuckedtip stage. It only gets better from here I stood up and brushed the dust off my trousers. I dreaded going home. Baba had not spoken to me for three days. We walked through the narrow Vishwanath Gali to reach the Gadhoiia main road CHETAN BHAGAT There s a career fair at Dr Sampooranand Sports Stadium in two weeks Vineet said. Go maybe you will find cheaper colleges There is no money. We are neckdeep in debt I said. Well no harm in paying a visit. You can get a discount especially from the new ones if you have a decent A I E E E rankI walked back home Hie onehour walk in the fresh air made me feel better temporarily. I should not talk to Baba about expensive private colleges I thought Maybe I should talk to him about me making money In a job rather than spending more First T would have to end his sulking thought I went to his room. He was lying in bed. T want to get a job Baba. Let me make some money before I decide about college He dldnt say a word. I continued T understand you are upset. I t isjustified. There is a Cafe Coffee Day opening in Sigra. It is a highclass coffee chain. They want staff. Class XHpass can apply X only heard the slow whirr of the fan in response Tve applied. I wont be working in a coffee shop forever. But they pay five thousand a month. Not bad right Baba kept quiet. I f you remain quiet I will assume you are okay with it Baba continued to mope silently despite my provocative comment I wanted him to scold yell anything and end this silence I leaned over him. Baba dont punish me like this I said. I held his arm to shake him. It felt limp and cold. Baba I said again. His body felt stiff. Baba said again. It finally dawned on me I had become anorphan.E a s e of cremation is one solid advantage of being in VaranasL The death industry drives the city The electric crematorium at Harishchandra Ghat and the original and still revered Manikamika Ghat burrs nearly fortyfive thousand bodies a yean or more than a hundred corpses a day. Only little children and people bitten by cobras are not cremated their bodies are often dumped straight into the river kKasyam maranam muktil goes the Sanskrit saying which means dying in Kashi leads to liberation. Hindus believe that if they die here there is an automatic upgrade to heaven no matter what the sin committed on earth It is amazing how god provides this wildcard entry at death which in turn allows my city to earn a living. Specialist onestop shops provide you everything from firewood to priests and urns to ensure that the dead person departs with dignity. Touts on Mamkarnika Ghat lure foreigners to come watch the funeral pyres and take pictures for a fee thereby creating an additional source of revenue. Varanasi is probably the only city on earth where Death is a tourist attraction. But for ali my citys expertise in death I had personally never dealt with a dead body in my entire life let alone that of my father. did not know how to react to Babas still body I did not or rather could not cry I dont know why. Perhaps because I was too stunned and emotionally drained out Perhaps had few emotions left after mourning my second entranceexam disaster Perhaps I had too much work related to the funeral. Or perhaps it was because I thought I had killed him. I had to organise a cremation then a couple of pujas didnt know who to invite. My father had very few friends. I called some of CHETAN BBAGAThis old students who had kept in touch. I informed Dubey uncle our lawyer more for practical reasons than anything else. The lawyer told Ghanshyam tayajL My uncle had sucked my fathers blood all his life. However his family now offered unlimited sympathy. found his wife Neeta tayiji at my doorstep. She saw me extended her arms and broke down. Its okay tayiji I said extracting myself from the bosom hug You need not have come What are you saying Husbands younger brother is like a son she Of course she did not mention the land she stole from her son. When is the puja she asked me. I have no idea I said. have to get the cremation done first Who is doing that she said. I shrugged my shoulders. Do you have the money to do a cremation at Manikarnika she said I shook my head The electric one at Harishchandra Ghat is cheaper I said. What electric It is broken most of the time anyway. We have to do a proper one. What are we here for Soon Ghanshyam tayaji arrived with the rest of his brood. He had two sons and two daughters all dressed in rich clothes. I didnt look like their relative at all After my uncle arrived they took over the cremation. They called more kith and kin. They arranged for a priest who offered a tenthousandrupee package for the cremation. My uncle bargained him down to seven. It felt macabre to bargain for a funeral but someone had to do it. My uncle paid the priest in crisp livehundredrupee notes. Twentyfour hours later I lit my fathers firewoodcovered body at Manikarnika Ghat Even though he had died I felt the fire must hurt him I remembered how he would dress me up for school when was a child comb my hair... Smoke rose from the pyre and tears finally welled up in my eyes. I began to sob Aarti and Raghav had come to the funeral They stood with me condoling in silenceREVOLUTION Half an hour later most of the relatives had left I watched as the flames ate up the wood felt a tap on my shoulder I turned around. Two muscular men with paansUined lips stood behind me. One of them had a thick moustache curved upwards Yes I said The ruousiached man pointed his finger at the pyre Are you hisCome aside he said Why I said le owed m two lakhs.Xlhanshyara tayaji wants to offer three lakhs I said to Dubey ancle shocked. He lipped through the document he had prepared for me. You sign here you get three lakhs. Loan sharks are after you. They are dangerous. I mi trying to hdp you I examined the document didnt really understand it Three lakhs is too low. They offered ten lakhs ages ago I said. hats right ages ago. When your father didnt take I t How they know you cant do anything. And you need the money I kept quiet. Dubey uncle stood up. I wondered whose side my lawyer I realise it isnt an easy time for you Think about it he said.I attended the career fair held in a giant tent put up in the Dr Sampooranand Sports Stadium. Vineet had urged me to go. Meet my friend Sunil there. He is the event manager of the fair and knows all the participants I entered the mam tent. Hundreds of stalls made it resemble a trade expo. Private colleges around the country were trying to woo the CHETAN BHAGATstudents ofVaranasi. Members of managing bodies of colleges stood with smiling faces. Banners inside the stalls displayed campus pictures like real estate projects. In cases where parts of the college building were under construction the pictures were an artists rendition Once complete this will be the best campus in Uttar Pradesh I heard one stallowner tell a set of anxious parents He skipped the part about how during construction students would have to study in makeshift classrooms surrounded by concrete mixers. Loud posters proclaimed college names along with emblems. Karnes varied but were often inspired by gods or grandfathers of rich promoters Select faculty and students from each college greeted us with glossy brochures of their institute in these stalls. Everyone wore suits and grinned like a welltrained flight crew. Hundreds of loser students like me moved restlessly from one stall to the next. Seventy per cent of the stalls comprised of engineering colleges. Medical hotel management aviation academies and a few other courses like BBA made up the rest reached the Sri Ganesh Vinayak College or SGVC stall at noon the designated place and time to meet Sunil. I picked up the SGVC brochure with its smiling students on the cover The boys seemed happier and the girls prettier than the JEE toppers in the Kota brochures. The back cover of the brochure carried praise forthe facilities and faculty of the institute enough to make an JIT director blush. Inside the booklet I found a list of the programmes offered From computer science to metallurgy SGVC offered every engineering course. I read through the entire brochure. I read the vision and mission statements of the founders. I read the colleges philosophy on education and how they were different Other career fair veterans grinned as they walked past me. I seemed to be the only person actually reading thedocument.Sunil found me at the stall for the Sri Ganesh Vinayak College deepin study.Gopal he said tentatively. Huh I turned around. SunilREVOLUTION Sunil gave me a firm handshake. Stubble and sunglasses covered most of his face. He wore a purple shirt and tight black jeans with a giant silver buckle What the hell are you doing he asked straight off. Readingthe brochureMsaid Are you stupid Go to the fees and placements page. See the average salary check the fee. If two years income pays the cost shortlist it else move on What about teaching methods Learning . Fuck learning Sunil said and snatched the brochure from my hand. found his mannerisms and language rather rough. He borrowed a calculator from one of the students at the stall See tuition fifty thousand hostel thirty thousand lets say twenty thousand more for the useless things they will make you buy. So you pay a lakh a year for four years. Average placement is one and a half lakhs fuck it Lets go. But was still doing the calculations. Move on There are a hundred stalls here We went to the next stall The red and white banner said Shri Chmtumal Group of Institutes NH Allahabad A small map showed the college location thirty kilometres from Allahabad city. cant go to a college called Chmtumal I said. Shut up. You never have to say your colleges name anyway. Sunil picked up a brochure. Within seconds he found the relevant page. Okay this is seventy thousand a year. Final placement one lakh forty thousand. See this makes more sense A fat man in his forties came to us Our placement will be even better this year he said. am fyoti Verma dean of students I had never expected a dean to sell the college to me. He extended his hand. Sunil shook it purposefullyYesyour fees are also lower than theirs I said and pointed to the SriGaxiesh stall. Their placement numbers are Me Ours are real ask any of our students fyoti aid. CHETAN BHAGATHe pointed to Ms students three boys and two girls who had worn suits for the first time in their life. Uhey smiled timidly. I browsed through the campus pictures in the Chintumal stall A man from the Sri Ganesh stall came to me He tapped my shoulderYes I said Mahesh Verma from Sri Ganesh. Did Chintumal say anything negative about us I looked at him. Mahesh in his forties and fat looked a lot like fyoti Verma. Did they Mahesh said again. I shook my head. You are considering Chintumal he said I nodded Why not Sri Ganesh Its expensive I said Whats your budget Maybe we can help you he said. What I said couldnt believe one could bargain down college fees Tell me your budget. I will give you a ten per cent discount if you sign up right now f turned to Sunil unsure of what to say or do next Sunil took charge of the situation We want thirty per cent off Chintumal is that much cheaper Sunil said They dont even have a building Mahesh said. How do you know said. Hes my brother. He broke off and started his own college. But it has got bad reports Mahesh said. Jyoti kept an eye on us from a distance. Yes the brothers did resemble each other. We dont care. Tell us your maximum discount Sunil said Come to my stall Mahesh signalled us to follow him. Stop Jyoti barred our wayREVOLUTION WhatI said. Why are you going to Sri Ganesh He is giving me a discount I said Did you ask me for a discount Did I say no Jyoti said his expression serious I had never seen a businessmaneunidean before Mahesh bhai please leave my stall jyoti said in a threatening tone. Hes my student. We hive spoken Mahesh bhai said and held my mist.Come son whafs your name Gopal said as lyoti grabbed my other wrist. But please stop pulling me. Hie brothers ignored my reqesi will give you Hie best discount. Dont go to Sri Ganesh and ruin your life. They dont even have labs. Those pictures in the brochure are of another college Jyoti said. Sin I dont even know baffled as me Shut up Jyoti a hitherto softspoken Mahesh screamed. Dont shout at me In my own stall Get out Jyoti said Mahesh gave all of us a dirty look in one swift move he ripped off the Chintumal banner. Jyotfs face went as red as his college emblem. He went to the Sri Ganesh stall and threw the box of brochures down. I tried to run out of the stall. Jyoti held me by my collar. Wait I will give you a seat for fifty thousand a year X e t . . . me .. go I panted. Mahesh returned with three people who resembled Bollywood thugs. Apparently they were faculty Uiey started to rip out all the hoardings of the Chintumal stall. Jyoti ordered his own security men to fight them. As I tried to escape one of Sri GanesKs goons pushed me. I fell facedown and landed on a wooden table covered in a white sheet. It had a protruding nail that cut my cheek Blood covered one side of my face Sweat drops appeared on my forehead. I had finally given my blood and sweat to studies. said and looked at Sunil. He seemed as CHJETAN BHAGATSunil helped me up I saw the blood on the white sheet and felt nauseous. A crowd had gathered around us I did not say anything and ran out. I left the stadium and continued to sprint down the main road for two hundred metres. stopped to catch my breath and heard footsteps as Sunil jogged towards me. Both of us held our sides and panted. Fuck Sunil said. Lucky escape We went to a chemists where I applied some dressing on my cheek Come I will take you to CCD. It opened last week Sunil saidWe walked to Cafe Coffee Day at IP Mall Sigra. Sunil bought us two cold coffees with a crisp new hundredrupee note. I could live on that cash for a vwtefe. What was that They own a college I said. I t is the Verma family from Allahabad. They are into country liquor Now they have opened a college WhyI said Money Theres huge money in private colleges. Plus it enhances their name in society. Now they are noble people in education not liquor They behaved like goons They are goons Brothers had a fight college split and now they try to bring each other down. cant do this I said DOE t worry we will get you another college. We will bargain hard. They have seats to fill I t scares me to even think of studying at these places. Liquor barons running colleges Yeah politicians builders straw to lick the cream off. makers. Anybody with experience in a shady business does really well in education Sunil said. He picked hisREVOLUTION Really Isaid. Shouldnt academicians be opening colleges Like exprofessors Are you crazy Education is not for misses. Theres a food chain of people at every step Sunil said He jiggled his leg as he spoke to me. He took out his mobile phone Cellphones had started to become common but they still counted as a status symbol. Sunil called someone who seemed io be In a crisis Calm down Chowbeyjt MLA Shuklaji has blessed the fair. Yes it is closing time. Give us two more hours.. Hold on. Sunil turned to me. Events business always my toes he said to me in an undertone. Mind if I step out I l l bebtefei.. .Sure f said. sat alone with my drink. I scanned the crowd. Rich kids bought overpriced doughnuts and cookies to go with their whippedcream coffee. Two men in leather jackets came inside CCD I recognised them from the funeral. I shifted sideways on my seat to avoid them. However they had already seen me hey walked up to my table Celebrating your fathers death said one. His muscular arm kept a cup of chai on the table T dont have the money right now I said in a soft voice. Then we will take your balls said the person with the moustache. He gripped a can of Coke in his right hand. Except they are not worth a lakh each the teacup goon said. They laughed Sunil returned after his call He was surprised to see the new guests. Your friends he said. shook my head. His fathers said the teacup guy. have seen you . J Sunil said. This is our town. We are everywhere the Coke guy said. You work for MLA Shuklaji dont you Sunil said.None of your business the teacup guy said his voice a tad nervous.I I S CHETAN RHAGATI saw you at his house. Hi Im Sunil. I am a manager at Sunshine Events. We work with M I A Shuklaji a lot. Sunil extended his hand After a few seconds of hesitation they shook Sunils hand. Your friend owes us money. Hed better pay up soon. Or else. The teacup guy paused after or else partly for effect but mostly because he didnt know what to say next Sunil and I kept quiet. The moustache goon tapped the table three times with his bike key. After a few more glares they left. I let out a huge sigh. Fear had flushed my face red T dont need college Fd be dead soon anyway I said. Ton okay Sunil said Let me get some more coffee Vd have preferred he gave the extra money to me instead of more coffee but kept silent. Over my second cup I gave Sunil a summary of the story so far my childhood Kofca my failure B abas death. Sunil placed his empty cup on the table with a clink. So now you have loans. And no source to pay them he summarised. My home maybe. But it is not worth much. And I wont have a place to live in after that I had mentioned the property dispute to Sunil in brief. I had not given him specific details. Thats an old dispute I said surprised Sunil caught on to i t What property is this Agricultural land I said dully. Where he said. Ten kilometres outside the city. Sunils eyes opened wide Thats quite close. How big is the land Thirty acres. Our share is fifteen acres And what does your uncle say Nothing He wants the full thing. It is a mess. Many papers are forged. The ease has been going on for twelve years. I finished my beverage. So yes Im fucked. Maybe they can sell my house and recover the money. Thanks for the coffeeREVOLUTION I stood up to leave. What will you do Sunil said still in his seat and pensive. I will join a shady parttime college and take whatever job I can get Wait sit down Sunil said What I sat down. Til suggest something to you. And I will help you with it as well But f need a cut. A big cut Cat said Cut of what myfuckedup So ten per cent Done Sunil said. Of what Of whatever you make. Ten per cent equity your w n t a d What venture said exasperated You will open a college.

Land close to the city he said. dont have i t The case has been dragging with no end sight We can fix that We Who And it is agricultural land. You can only grow crops there. Its the law I said. there are people in our country who are above the law Sunil said Who I said MLA Shukkjs he aiu Shukh who Our MLA Raman Lai Shukla YouVe never heard of him Sunil said You mentioned him earlier the phone said Yes. I have done twenty events with his blessings. How else could I get city authority approvals I personally take his cut to him. I will take you too For my own cnC he sakl and winked at me. life CHBTAN BHGATYes cut Ten per cent Forgot already What exactly are you saying Let us meet Shuklaji Bring whatever property papers you have You serious Do I look like someone who is not serious Sunil said. I saw his gelled hair and the flashy sunglasses perched on his head You want me to open a college I havent even been to college I said. Most people who own colleges In India havent. Stupid people go to college. Smart people own them said Sunil. Til set it up for next week. And remember. What He snapped his fingers My ten per centIIA a r t i and I went for a long boat ride. Her green dupatta flew backward in the early morning breeze Decided what to do next she asked. am exploring private engineering colleges.fesdToo expensive and too shady I said. I paused to rest Hie boat stood still in the middle of the river. I wondered if Aarti would come and sit next to me to massage my palms. She didnt sSo What next Aarti said A correspondence degree and a job What about the loans Manageable Baba settled most of them lied I did not want to burden her with my woes and spoil my time with her Good. Dont worry it will work out She got up to sit next to me Shetook my hand in hers and as if thinking of something else began to crack my knuckles. You are happy with Raghav right I asked. I hoped she wouldnt be but was pretending like I wanted her to be. Oh yesJ She looked at me with shining eyes. Raghav is a good person I withdrew my hand. She sensed my disappointment. never said hes not I looked away You cool Yeah I said and managed a fake smile How is he anyway Told his parents he wont take up engineering as a profession. They arent too happy with that. CHETAN BHAGATHes an idiot What will he do Journalism she said. He loves it Thats what he is meant to do. He wants to change things. Hes also joined university politics. Totally stupid I said I picked up the oars again. Aarti went back to tttMCfl We kept silent on the ride back. The splash of oars in the water was the only sound breaking the silence. Aariis hair had grown and now reached her waist I saw her eyelashes move every time she blinked. The dawn sun seemed to light up her skin from the inside f avoided looking at her lips. If I looked at them I wanted to kiss them. She belongs to someone else now even your limited brain should know that My head knew this but my heart didnt Why did we grow up Gopal Aarti said. Things were so much simpler earlier had never been to an MLAs house before. We reached Shuklajis sprawling bungalow in the Kachehri locality at three in the afternoon. Police jeeps were parked outside and security guards surrounded the entire property.Sunil introduced himself at the gate and later we were let in.Several villagers sat in the front lawn awaiting their turn to meet the MLA. Sunil had said MLA Shukla stayed alone. His family mostly stayed abroad as his two sons went to college there. Filled with party workers MLA ShuWs home resembled a party office more than a residence. Sunil had brought along Girish Bedi an experienced education consultant I had a rucksack full of property documents and courtrelated papers. Guards checked my bag three times before we reached the MLAs office. A middleaged man in a crisp white kurtapyjama sat behind an ornate polished wooden desk. Despite a slight potbelly for a politician Shuklaji could be considered handsome. He gestured at us to sit as he continued to speak on his cellphone Tell the scientist that Shukla wants to see the report first Yes I have to see it. Its my Ganga too. Yes okay f have a meeting now bye.MSSJISFTLIThe MLA sifted through the files on his desk as he spoke to us. Sunil sir. Sunshine Events W ... we do career fairs Sunil said the stammer in his voice in sharp contrast to his confidence in the outside world Tell me the work Shuklaji said Land sir Sunil said Where How much Shuklaji said. His eyes stayed on his files as his ears tuned in. Politicians can multitask better than most people Thirty acres ten kilometres outside the city on the Lucknow Highway Sunil said. The MLA stopped his pen midway. He looked up at us. Whose he said He closed his files to give us his M l attention. Mine sir I said No idea why I called him sir. am Gopal Mishra I opened my rucksack and placed the property documents on the table And you Shuklaji said turning to Bedi. Education consultant. He helps design and open new colleges. Our own person Sunil said. New college Shuklaji said. Tt is agricultural land sin Sunil said. You can obtain permission to convert agricultural land to educational use Bedi spoke for the first time. You look young Shuklaji said to me. Who are your parents They died sir I said. Hmmm. Whats the problem Shuklaji said. His finger traced the location of the land to the centre of the city My uncle I said This is right near the upcoming airport Shuklaji said as he made sense of the map. Ts it I said. Shuklaji picked up his intercom. He told his staff not to disturb him until this meeting was over. Gopal tell me everything about the land dispute Shuklaji said. Over the next hour I told him my entire story. And the fact is I even owe your men two lakhs I said as I ended my monologue. CHETAN BHAGATWould you like tea Soft drink Shuklaji said. I shook my head. You owe money to my men Shuklaji said No sir not your men Sunil said and stamped my foot. Bedi sir tell him your view did not realise that the loan sharks operate with the MLAs blessings but denied any overt links with him. Ideal engineering college site sir Bedi said His share of fifteen acres is enough Why fifteen When there is thirty why would we take fifteen Shuklaji said I felt overwhelmed with emotion. For thefirsttime in my life a powerful person had shown support for me missed out that he said we Sunil gave me a smug smile. He had brought me to the right place. Fifteen is enough sir said not sure how we would get even that. Thirty Keep the remaining for later. It is close to the city ... Once the college opens and the airport Is built we may even get residential or commercial zoning Shuklaji saidI didnt really understand what he said but I figured he knew morethan me Besides he seemed to be on my side But how will we get this I said. My uncle had been sitting on the property for years.fYouleave that to .us Shuklaji said You tell me this can you run acollege Me Yes because you will be the face and name of the college. will be a silent partner he said. But how I said. T have no experience. I have no moneylMrBedi will give you the experience. I will give you the money forconstruction and everything else J am missing something here Why had the world suddenly decided tohelp me Whafs the catchR E V O L U T I O N ZOZO Shuklaji sir if you could tell him your terms. And of course whatever you fee is good tor me Sunil said and gave an obsequious grin don t want anything. Open a college it is good for my city Shuklaji said. Nobody believed him. Yet we had to indulge him Sir please Sunil said that wont be fair Til think about my terms But tell me boy are you up to it Shuklaji looked at me I think grew older by ten years under that gaze. I hid my hesitation as much as possible. How about we get the land and just sell it I said. I t is tough to sell the land with all the past cases Shuklaji said. I t is one thing to get possession for you quite another to find a new buyer Exactly The cases how do we fix them I said Shuklaji laughed. We dont fix cases. We fix the people in the cases. The MLA had laughed but his eyes showed a firm resolve. He seemed like the kind of guy who could fix people. And more than acquiring the land I wanted to teach my relatives a lesson. Tf you can fix them you can take whatever share you want I said. Fifteen acres for me Shuklaji said. T will keep it until the area gets rezoned to commercial or residential. We will make the college in the other fifteen How much ownership in the college do you want I said. Whatever you want College is a trust no profit there Shuklaji said with no particular expression Really I said surprised. Tt is true Bedi spoke after a long time Every college must be incorporated as a nonprofit trust. There are no shareholders only trustees Whywould a private player open a nonprofit college I said.Bedi took a deep breath before he proceeded to explain. Well you take a profit. The trustees can take out cash from the trust showing it as an expense. Or take some fee in cash and not account for it. Or ask a contractor to pay you back a portion of what you pay them There are many more ways CHETAN B HAG ATBedi continued speaking till I interrupted him Wait a minute arent these illegal methods Everyone fell silent Shuklaji spoke after a while. dont think this boy can do it. You have wasted my time. Bedi and Sunil hung their heads in shame. had let them down with my curiosity about propriety. am sorry I am only trying to understand I said. WhatBedi said hts tone irritated Are you telling me that the only way to make money from a college is through illegal methods Sorry I am not being moral only questioning. Well Bedi said you are not actually supposed to make money So why would anybody open one I said. For the benefit of society like us politicians Shuklaji said. Everyone but me broke into laughter. I guess the joke was on stupid naive one. Listen Gopal Sunil said that is how the rules are. They are stupid. Now you can either figure out a way around them or remain clueless. There has to be a trust you and Shuklaji sir will be trustees. Bedi will explain everything. Bedi gave me a reassuring nod. Yes the man knew the system and how to bend it. Mr Bedi also explain to the boy not to question legality much. Education is not the business for Mm then Shuklaji said. Of course Bedi smiled Shukla sir taking money out of the trust is the least of the problems. What about all the permissions and approvals required Every step requires special management So thats what the boy has to do. I am not visible in this. I am only the trustee to benefit society Shuklaji said Do what I said Dont worry I will explain it Bedi said. You need Varanasi Nagar Nigams approval for the building plans AICTE approval for the college. There are inspections. Everyone has to be taken care of. It is standard.REVOLUTION QO Shhf Shuklaji reprimanded Dont mention all this hre You do your discussions outside. Leave now We stood up to go. Stay for a minute Gopal the MLA saidYes I said after Sunil and Bedi had left the room Will you do what it takes Shuklaji said dont want t waste my time otherwise. Tell me now if you want to quit I paused to think. Its not easy I admitted Tt is never easy to become a big man in life Shuklaji sah. I kept quiet You want to be a big man Gopal I continued to look down. I examined the black and whre patterns on the Italian marble floor. Or you want to remain an average kid while your friendace ahead QffQU I swallowed the lump in my throat. I looked up to make y e contact with him. You have a girlfriend Gopal I shook my head. You know why Because you are a nobody nodded The memory of Aarti and Raghav kissing other passionately in the BHU car park Hashed through my mind. If f i a d made it to BHU and Raghav had gone to Kota would her decisiorhave been different I saw Shuklaji. Every inch of him felt wrong. But hfeed me a chance A job an admission a fucking chance that is all a needs in life sometimes. Til do it. It isnt like I am the only guy in India payingbis said. But I want to be big Shuklaji stood up. He came around his desk and patte . m y back. Tou are already a big man he said because you have me H i n d you. Mow go and leave your harami uncles details with my secret outside. What about the money I owe your people I said. Two lakhs Its a joke for me forget it Shuklaji sal fJe went back to his desk and opened a drawer. He took out twogfidles of CHETAN BHAGATtenthousand rupees and tossed them at me One for Sunil the other for you he said. Why for meV I asked. For running my college Director sir He grinned.illI accepted Shuklajis ten thousand bucks if only to pay for basic necessities I allowed myself one indulgence I took Aarti out for dinner to Taj Ganga the most expensive restaurant in town. Are you sure Aarti asked again as we entered the coffee shop at the Taj. We could always eat chaat at the ghats She wore a new full length dark blue dress her relatives had sentfrom the US. She had matched it with fake understated gold jewellery purchased from Vihwanath Gali My treat I said. The waiter pulled out a chair for Aarti. She thanked him as we sat down. Aarti wanted to watch her weight but eat chocolate cake too. We decided to have soup and salad for dinner so we could save calories for dessert. She stirred the hot soup with a spoon. Sorry but how did you get the money for this Baba left you a huge will I laughed. No he left me loans. Then I am starting a new business. Smuggling Aarti inclined her head to one side. Shut up. I am opening a college. What Aarti said loud enough for the entire place to hear. Sorry she whispered. Did you say you are opening a college Yeah on my disputed land How Isnt the land stuck And how will you make the coEege T have partners. Good partners. Who Aarti said. CHETAN BHAGAT tell you. We are finalising plans. Really Aarti said Oh so you are serious Yeah it is fifteen acres right outside the city. If we settle the dispute arid get rezoning done it is ideal for a college I repeated Bedis words Wow Aarti said and chuckled. You are hitting the big time Gopal She meant it as a joke but it hurt a little. Why You didnt think I could No dicta mean that Aarti said. am just surprised have to do something in life Sure. You will do more than something. What about your uncle We are trying to reach an amicable settlement with him said. Shuklas men who handled the loanshark business had initiated the settlement process with Ghanshyam tayaji. Amicable is not the word one could use to describe their methods. They had visited my uncles house thrice. The first time they emptied a bottle of goats blood in his front balcony. The second time they stabbed all the sofas and beds in the house with an assortment of knives. The third time when theyfinallyspoke they brought out guns and proposed to buy off my uncles share of disputed land for eight lakh rupees. I did not want to give Aarti all these extra details. What kind of college she said. Engineering Cool Aarti said Tf I want to be a big man I have to do big things I said. You were always a big man to me Gopal. You know why Why Because you have a big heart. Aarti lightly stroked my hand on the site My heart big or small skipped a beat at her touch. I quickly launched into small talk. How are things with you Hows college Borng But I am joining an aviation academy Whats that They train you to become aflightattendant. The classrooms look like the interiors of a plane.REVOLUTION Really I mused There is so much happening in education Teah most of us only get to be students Mot everyone can open a college she teased. I smiled. Long way to go. Its difficult I said You have faced more difficult things in life before. You will make it Aarti said confidently You think so I said She nodded. Her nod meant the world to me. I wanted to ask her to date me again. Somehow I thought with my new college plan she might be inclined to say yes. Of course only my brain comes up with such flimsy theories.. Hows Raghav I asked to bring myself back to reality A bit low actually she said. I felt a warm glow. Really Why expressed fake concern He lost university elections for general secretary Oh I said. Does it matter Tt did to him. He lost because he wouldnt horsetrade with other hostels. He wanted to fight fair Im not surprised he lost I said spearing a carrot. He believes one has to be fair and win. Else what is tht point of winning Aarti said Life doesnt work like that does it I said chewing slowly. T dont know. That is how it should work Aarti said. Hei going to contest again next year. Doesnt he do too much I said Oh yeah between his BTech course magazine and elections he hardly has any time for me And you like that No but I have no choice. If it makes him happy so be it We finished our dinner. The chocolate cake arrived. Her eves lit up. She pulled the plate towards herself Dont steal my cake she said and grtemed. Raghav is such a lucky guy to have you Aarti I said. Thanks she said and gave a shy smile. CHETAN BHAGATAsrth can I ask you something Yeah She looked at me her spoon poised above the cake Nothing leave some cake for me if you can I said and signalled forThe doorbell woke me at midnight I rubbed my eyes and readied for the door still half asleep. My uncle aunt and their son my thirtyyearold cousin Ajay stood outside Ghanshyam tayaji I said What happened Please come in My relatives sat on the torn sofa in the front room. They didnt speak for five minutes. You have not come so late because you missed me right I said. Why are you doing this to us Ajay exploded. Doing what said. Do you want water Tea No my uncle said. Gopal pay attention to your karma. God is watching. You will have to pay one day. Do not do this to us. Do what I said And why had they come at this time of the night Bittoo hasnt come home from nursery school my aunt said and burst into tears. This time they seemed real unlike the crocodile ones at Babas funeral. They had come home because Bittoo Ajays fouryearold son whom I had seen only once in his mothers lap at my fathers funeral was missing. Oh that is terrible I said. And this is about my karma Its those people who want to buy the land my uncle said We know they are with you What are you talking about I said. My uncle folded his hands. Dont do this to us he said. T am not doing anything. Some people came to me to buy the land too. But I told them I cannot sell it I said. Really Ajay said. How can I Its disputed right I said. But the people who came to us dont want to buy They want us to settle the bank cases settle the dispute and give it all to you uncle said.REVOLUTION Thats strange. So now the question is do you value the land more or Bittoo Correct Shut up Ajay said. We know it is you who wants to buy it dont have money to buy food. How can I buy land I scratched my head. Who are these people my uncle said. T dont know. You can go to the police said but they sound like crooks Avoid the police my aunt said They can do anything. Bittoo is a little young thing it wont be difficult to hide his body. Anyway it is Varanasi dead bodies are easy to dispose of I said Ajay jumped up from the sofa and grabbed my collar. know you are involved. Your father was straight you are not he said his eyes wild. Xeave my collar brother right now I said in a calm but firm tone. Ajay s mother tugged at her sons hand. Ajay released me What are they offering I said Eight lakhs my uncle said Thats not bad I said. Thats a fraction of the market price. But more than double of what you offered me I said. You are involved Ajay glared at me. Go home tayaji and think it over We all love Bittoo more than the laml Why is this happening to us my aunt exclaimed at the door its ali karma. Tayaji will explain it to you I smiled as I shut the doorIt took three nights without Bittoo to make my relatives realise the value of the eightlakh offer. I received a call from the MLAs office when Mr Ghanshyam Mishra and Mr Ajay Mishra signed the papers.Sharma here PA to Shuklaji the caller said MLA sahib has invited you for dinner tonight CHKTAN BHAGATCheers Shuklaji said as we clinked our whisky glasses together. Bedi Sunil and I sat with him in his huge living room. It had three separate seating areas with plush velvet sofas coffee tables and elaborate lamps and chandeliers. Three waiters served kebabs nuts and minisamosas in napkinlined china plates. noticed pictures of Shuklajis family on the wall. Mikhil and Akhil my sons Shuklaji said. Both are studying in the US Will keep them away for a while Some said Shuklaji was divorced. Others said he had another family in Lucknow I didnt feel the need to know Land is a big step Bedi said grimly. But theres a long way to go. We are meeting the VNN people next week. Meanwhile we should take care of the trust formalities. Bedi explained how VNN or the municipality would give us the crucial agriculturaltoeducational land rezoning permit and dear plansso we can commence construction.Get the rezoning done soon. Ive not paid eight lakhs for the land to grow riceShuklaji said. We will Bedi said They know who is behind this. You are not a small entity sir That is true Shuklaji said in a dismissive tone to Bedi for stating the obvious. But we have to take care of VNN no Yes of course Bedi said. I t s rezoning. The land value multiplies five times. Not cheap. How muchShuklaji saidOf course the rate is different for you. Id imagine ten lakhs What Shuklaji said shocked. Bedifinishedhis drink in a large sip. Its thirty acres sir. For a normal person it would be forty. See that is why people like me have to come to education. What is happening in this country Shuklaji said D M has to bless it too. But Fradhan is honest. However if it is for acollege and VNN recommends he will approve it Bedi said.How honestShuklaji saidR E V O L U T I O N ZOZO Honest enough to not take money But not so honest that he will stop others from taking it Thats good If you are honest keep it to yourself Sunil said speaking for the first time that evening Sunil Shuklajj said Whatrsirf Ton leave now. will send something for you. But we will take care of this project from now Shuklaji said. Sir h u t S u n i l said You have done your job Shuklaji said and handed him a bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label Sunil took the cue. He thanked him for the bottle bowed as much as the human spine allowed and left. know DM Pradhan his daughter is a friend told Shuklaji. Not much of an issue there. Still good to have his blessings Shuklaji said. Sure I said. Shuklaji went inside his bedroom. He returned with a heavy plastic bag. He gave it to me. Whats this I said. Ten lakhs he said for VNN Ten lakhs I said. My hands trembled as held the heavy bag I had never seen or lifted that much money. Tfs just a number the MLA said Bediji help the boy And help yourself too. I dont like empty glasses. Sure Shuklaji Bedi said and called for the waiter. Are people in education happy with money or they want other stuff too Shuklaji asked Bedi. Like what Bedi asked. Girls if they want to have a good time I have a man Vmod who can arrange that MLA Shukla said. Oh will let you know. Money usually does the job though Bedi Midi CHBTAN BHAGATGood He changed track. Can Gopal work from your office for a while Until he has his own Of course Shuklaji The waiters ran to refill our glasses The trust papers are ready. We can sign them this week. But one question Gopal Bedi said. What I said. Whats the name of the college Bedi said. I hadnt thought about it. I have no idea. Maybe something that signifies technology And our city Shuklaji said. Let me tell people I did this for them when the time comes. GangaTech said. Shuklaji patted my shoulder. Well done. I like you Gopal You will go very far Shuklaji personally filled my glass to the brim with whisky.Iflippedthrough the documents Bedi had plonked on my desk. I sat in an extra room at his education consultancy office Pay to incorporate a trust I said. Yes to the Registrar of Companies. Every trust has to be registered there Bedi said But why pay a bribe We are opening a nonprofit trust I said. We are paying a bribe because if we dont the Registrar will stall our approvalHe was irritated I sighed in disbelief. Anyway forty thousand maximum. Now can you please sign here Bedi said. Over the next two hours I signed on. every page of the six copies of the fortypage GangaTech Education Trust Incorporation document. I cracked my knuckles while Bedi hunted up some more stuff for me tosignthis I said when he handed me a stack of letters. Each letter had a thick set offilesattached to itYour application to the University Grants Commission or the UGC Whatsto open a college. Thefilescontain details about the proposed collegeI went through the files. It had sections such as course descriptions facilities offered and faculty hiring plan. Tt is standard stuff taken from earlier applications Bedi said. I signed the letters. So they send an approval or what I said. They will send a date for inspection of the site. Once they inspect they will give you an inprinciple approval to start construction T imagine we have to pay somebody to clear the inspection I said. CHETAN BHAGATBed laugheL You learn fast. Of course we pay A thick packet to every inspector. However right now we pay to obtain an inspection date. First things first. My eyebrows went up. Joking right I said. Mo any government work especially in education requires a fee. Get used to it He then listed out the palms we had to grease in order to open a place to teach kids in our country Apart from the UGC we had to apply to ATCTE or the All India Council for Technical Education. They clear the engineering colleges. Also every private college requires a government university affiliation. For that we had to get approvals from the vicechancellor of a state university. Shuklajis connections and a generous envelope would do the trick. Otherwise the vicechancellor can create a lot of hassle Bedi said speaking from past experience So who are these UGC and AICTE inspectors anyway I said University lecturers from government colleges are appointed as inspectors Of course since it is such a lucrative job the lecturers have to bribe to become one Bedi said. Whom Senior management at UGC or someone in the education ministry. Anyway that is their business. We have to focus on ours. Please inform Shuklaji we will need funds for all this. IMddidDont forget the VNN meeting Bedi said. And definitely dont forget the bag cant wait to get rid of it I said. Tt is scary to keep so much cash in the house. Dont worry Bedi said One VNN visit and it will all be gone.We reached the Varanasi Nagar Nigam office opposite Shaheed Udyaan at six in the evening. The official had told us to come after working hours. If you are willing to pay government offices can do more overtime than MNCs.REVOLUTION Welcome welcome I am Sinha a man greeted us in the empty reception area. He led us upstairs. We climbed tip two floors of the dilapidated building Sinha deputycorporator had known Shuklaji for over a decade and referred to him as his brother. I f my big brother wants it consider it done Sinha said. He didnt mention that big brother would need to give little brother a gift took out the maps property documents and our formal application Sinha pored over them with a sonorous mmni We cm only start when we have the land rezoned I said. Rezoning is tough Sinha said Higherups have to approve How long will it take I said You look young Sinha said. Excuse me I said. Impatience the first folly of youth. You are opening a college what is the hurry Its still going to take years. But I want to get all the approvals done IsaM Bedi signalled me to be quiet. Sinha laughed Dont you have to get the building plan approval too the deputycorporator said Yes Bedi said. Can your junior officers handle that Send the documents to me send everything home. Everything Sinha said stressing the last word. I got the drift I patted the plastic bag I had kept on the floor. I have brought something here I said In the office Sinha stood up hurriedly Are you crazy I had brought the money to show how serious we were about getting the job done. Obviously I didnt expect him to take cash over the counter Bedi sir teach him how it is done. He will be a disaster Sinha said as he led us out of the office I hugged the heavy red plastic bag closer. How much by the way Sinha enquired as we came outsideI said CHETAN BHAGATNot for rezoning and building plan Sinha said. Its a college please be reasonable I said am being reasonable But ten is too less. Fifteen Sinha said No concession for Shuklaji I said. This is already half of what I take Sinha said Eleven I said. I was bargaining with him as if was buying a TVshirt O f course the thought of the amount involved numbed me. Twelve and a half. Done Do not embarrass me before my big brother Sinha said. I didnt argue further. I had to make arrangements for the remaining You are a good bargainer Bedi said to me while dropping me off at Shuklajis residenceYou smash it said Shuklaji handing me a coconut at the entrance of the college site. A crowd of his sycophants surrounded us. The bhoomipufan ceremony marked the beginning of construction. I had run around for three months to obtain the two dozen approvals to make this day possible. The UGC and AICTE inprinciple approvals had finally arrived. The final inspections would be conducted when the college was ready to open. For now we had permission to begin construction The only other thing we needed were gods blessings Fortunately that didnt require a bundle of cash held the coconut in my hand and looked around Aarti hadnt Do it son Shuklaji said. I couldnt wait for her any longer. I guess the day did not mean as much to her as it did to me I smashed the fruit imagining it to be Raghavs head. As it cracked a sliver of the shell cut my finger. People clapped around me. I took the cut finger to my mouth and sucked the bruise. GangaTech Engineering College two labourers fixed a metal hoarding in the muddy ground. I should have felt more emotion. After allREVOLUTION I had slogged for months. However I felt nothing. Maybe because knew the exact amount of bribes it took to reach this day Seventytwo lakhs twentythree thousand and four hundred rupees to obtain everything from electricity connections to construction site labour approvals. Shuklaji had invited over a hundred guests including members of the press We had a caterer who served hot samosas and jalebis in little white boxes. Shuklaji addressed everyone from a makeshift dais. Three more years and this dream will be a reality This is a gift to my city which deserves the b e s t he said. I sat in the front row I kept turning around to see if Aarti had arrived. After Shuklaji speech the press asked questions. Most were simple relating to the courses that would be on offer and the upcoming college facilities. However a few tough journalists did not spare him. Shukla sir are you the owner of this college How much is your stake one reporter asked. T am a trustee I have no stake. It is a nonprofit entity Shuklaji m i Who is handing the land and construction Mr Gopal Mishra here owns this land. I want to encourage young talent so I helped him raise some funds Shuklaji said and wiped his forehead with a handkerchief Funds from where the reporter continued. From various benefactors. Dont worry somebody has given money not taken it. Media is so suspicious these days Shuklaji said. Sir what is happening in the Ganga Action Plan scam You are named in that a reporter from the last row asked. It is an old and dead story. There is no scam. We spent the money to clean the river Shuklaji said. This new topic galvanised ail the reporters. Everyone raised their hand as they scrambled to ask questions. No more questions thank you very much Shuklaji said. The reporters ran behind him as he left the site I stayed back ensuring that the guests were served the refreshments CHETAN BHAGATA truck arrived with bricks iron rods and other construction materials. Behind it I saw a white Ambassador car with a red light on top. Aarti got out of the car upon spotting me T am so so so sorry she saidAre the prayers over Can the prayers ever be over without Aarti I said.Varanasi Tkrm More Years LaterJ V I y arrival went unnoticed amidst loud music and die chatter of people. Highclass parties make me nervous and would have happily skipped Raghavs graduation bash that day if I could. I only went because I didnt want to come across as envious. I felt no envy. My college GaiigaTech was to open in three months. After three years of working day and night I had my building ready even had faculty recruitment interviews lined up and had obtained a date for the ACTE inspection. A stupid BHU degree meant little when Id be issuing my own degrees soon. Hey Raghav said in a slightly tipsy voice. Buddy where were you Negotiating with a computer supplier I said. Raghav didnt seem to hear. For my college. We are setting up a computer centre I said. Raghav raised his hand Good show. Give me a highfive He clapped my hand with his so hard that it hurt. You need a drink Raghav said. Theres the bar He gestured towards the dining table on which were beer rum and coke. People made their own drinks in plastic glasses. Raghavs parents had agreed to spend the night at some relatives house so that Raghav and his collegemates could have a night of debauchery. I looked around at Raghavs pals Thirty boys most of them wearing glassesand old Tshirts and jabbering about job offers and only three girls who given their lack of fashion sense had to be from an engineering college. I got myself a rum and coke. I looked for ice. There was none on the dining table so I headed for the kitchen. A girl with long tresses her back CHETAN BHAGATto me was arranging candles on a huge chocolate cake. The cake had a gearshaped design on it and said Happy Graduation in perky white marzipan letters. Gopal Aarti said as she saw me struggle with the icetray Id removed from the fridge. Her voice startled me. Tts been like Aarti said a year T had not kept in touch with her. Hi I said. Its not like I wanted to evade her. But saw no upside to remaining in touch either. I found it more productive to scream at construction workers than hear stories about her dates with her boyfriend. I started avoiding her calls and soon she too drifted away Yeah I am sorry my fault I said. T got very busy at the site. She took the icetray from me twisted it to release the icecubes and put two of them in my glass T am not asking for an explanation. understand I am not that important to you now That is not true. I had my site you had Raghav I said. We have our own lives and have a boyfriend. Doesnt mean it is my entire life okay Aarti vSaidL Well he kind of is isnt he I said. offered her my drink. She declined. She went back to decorating the cake. Nothing like that. No one person can be that important. Why I said. Something wrong Mo no she said too quickly thought. Its great Raghavs graduated. He has a job offer from Infosys. My aviation course finishes soon. It is still as strong as ever What I said. Us Us Me and Raghav she said. Of course I said.REVOLUTION She lifted the cake to lake it to Raghav Tit keep m touch said That would be nice I havent sat in a boat for a year she said and smiled. The confusing confounding Aarti had returned. What did she mean Did she miss the boat rides Did she miss being with me Was she tossing a bone at me or was she just being witty I came out of the kitchen lost in my thoughts. Everyone gathered around Raghav. He held a knife in his hand. Aarti stood next to him. Raghav cut the cake. Everyone dapped and hooted. I guess graduating from college is a big deal. Raghav fed the first piece to Aarti Aarti offered a piece to Raghav. As he opened his mouth Aarti smeared the cake on his face. Everyone guffawed and clapped hard. I felt out of place. What the fuck was I doing here Why did these guys even invite me Speech Speech the crowd began to demand of Raghav. Aarti took a tissue and wiped his face. Well friends congrats to ail of you on your graduation Raghav said. We have spent four fabulous years together. As we get ahead with our lives X am sure we will always have a special placeforoureampns in our .hearts We will still be together dude a bespectacled boy interrupted him atlnfosys Seven people raised their glasses high in the air. They all had offers from the software company. Cheers they said Raghav kept quiet. Actually I have an announcement he said. T wont be taking up the job offer. What people exclaimed in unison. Yes I have decided to stay here Raghav said and draped his arm around Aartis waist to be near my love. Yeah right Aarti said wiping a blob of icing from Raghavs cheek. Tell them the real reason. That is the real reason he chuckled. CHBTAN BHAGATNo Aarti said turning to the crowd. Mr Raghav Kashyap is staying back to join Dainik as a reporter. Murmurs of surprise ran through the crowd. Raghav had edited the college magazine and even done a newspaper internship. However few knew he had the courage to chuck Infosys to become a newspaper Raghav chatted with his friends. Aarti sliced the cake for everyone. The music became loud again. I made another drink and leaned against the wall wondering if I should leave Aarti offered me cake on a paper plate. declined. So when does your college open she said. In three months GangaTech starts admissions said. Really Can I apply She laughed. Til print you a degree if you want you do not even have to attend classes I said. Really she said wagging a finger. Yeah give me an Electronics Engineer degree like Raghavs. But better marks than him Sure I said. She laughed even more I had tried so hard the last four years to get over Aarti. Yet one laugh of hers had set back years of effort. Suddenly it felt like we had never been apart. I had to leave. T better go I muttered. Why she said You just came T dont fit in here Its okay. I hardly know these people either. All nerdy engineers. Come lets go to the balconyWe sat in Raghavs balcony I took little sips of my drink. The breeze blew Aartis hair in my face. I moved away a bit You finished your course at the aviation academy I said. Yes Frankfinn ended two months ago. I am applying to all the airlines Lets see if they call me for interviews she said. Theres no airline in VaranasLREVOLUTION Yeah f i t have to move to Delhi or Mumbai. theres even a new lowcost airline In Bangalore. It depends. Tn what I said Where I get a job. Of course now it is complicated as RaghaVs here Fie can be a journalist in other cities too I said. guess she said as she tucked her hair behind her ear. But he likes VaranasL He knows this place and the issues here. How is your drink Can I take a sip I. gave her my glass How much does he get paid for this Dainik job said I had to know how much Raghav made. She took a few sips and kept the glass for herself. A third of what Infosys would give him she said. Wow And his parents are okay with it No way They went ballistic when he told them it isnt just about the money he isnt using his engineering degree. They are still upset lor So what He doesnt care. He feels the revolution begins at home. Society changes only when individual family norms are challenged Revolution I said. Oh yeah he is quite into that. The Great Indian Revolution. Oops finished your drink. I am so sorry she said and touched my arm in apology Its fine. Ill make another one. And you are cool with his career choice Of course I believe one should follow their passion. Am I not working towards mine So an air hostess isnt the same as a revolution but still thats me. What exactly is this revolution I said irritated. Well Raghav believes there will be a real peoples revolution in India one day thats his thing. Why Ask him he will explain it to you. Wait I will get us more drinks CHETAN BHAGATShe went back in. I waited in the balcony. I did not want to be with the smug software types inside. I imagined a day when students from my college would get jobs I wondered if big software companies would ever visit GangaTech. Of course we had to open for admissions first She came back with a tray. It had two drinks and a plate with sandwiches cake and potato chips. T thought you might be hungry she said. Aarti cannot help but be the caring mother types. Thanks I said taking my glass. Now tell me why did you forget me Aarti said. Who said I had forgotten you I said. Our eyes met. ft felt awkward after about three seconds. I blinked first T have a mobile phone now. Do you want my number she said. Sure I said. Shuklaji had given me a cellphone too. We exchanged numbers. Td like to see your college sometime she said. Let it open fit do an inauguration I said. Is the college your passion she said. I dont know. Its the best opportunity life gave me. Have you felt passionate about anything Gopal Its an amazing feeling Aarti said. I remained silent as I stared at her my passion. Anythingshe said. Money I want to make lots of money I said. She threw up her hands in the air. Oh come on Aarti said Thats not passion. ThatVambition I dont know lets go in. I stood up. I didnt want Raghav to see us Stay here she said cajolingly and pulled me down by my hand. We havent met for ages. What are you up to Do you have a girlfriend I shook my head. You should get one. It is amazing to be in love A feeling even better than passion she said.REVOLUTION Its amazing to be in love only when the other person loves you back I said. I regretted my statement instantly. Ouch Below the belt am sorry I said That was so long ago. And Raghav and I are happy So happy Should we go back in I said if you are willing to open iifl Aarts said you can find someone nice fepafc dont need anyone I said and looked away. She held my chin and turned my face towards her You will own a college. I will be fust a ilight attendant selling chips i f am lucky Yon can get someone better Someone better than yon saidTotally she said That is not possible Aarti I said. Before she could answer I stood up again and returned to the parly f went up to Raghav and told him I had to leave to meet a contractor. He didiit seem to mind it much I came outside his apartment and took the stairs down. Aarti came after me. tlopalf I looked back at her from the steps. What said. Dont tell me you still have feelings for meV I swallowed hard. Not at ail I said and sprinted out.w M o w long is your break I shouted A group of labourers sat under the banyan tree near the main campus building twothirty lunch ended We had only a week left for thefinalAICTE inspection. The classrooms needed a last lick of paint The workers didnt care. Your work will fee done sahib said one of the workers folding the newspaper he had been sitting on. He wore a tattered vest and dark trousers with cream paint ail over it My college wont open if the inspector is unhappy with us I said. Who is going to say no to your college the worker stood up. The other workers tightened their turbans. They picked up their brushes and moved to the classrooms I remained under the banyan tree exhausted by my daily ritual of hauling up the men every two hours I glanced down at the newspaper left behind by the workers. A headline caught my attention Varanasi needs more colleges I picked up the newspaper. Under the headline was the writers name RaghavKashyap The article talked about how the youth population of Varanasi had grown significantly in the last ten years. At the same time the number of colleges had not kept pace with the demand. It made recommendations on how the government could make education a priority. He even argued that the government should allow colleges to make a legitimate profit so that corporate bodies could enter the sector and improve quality. Even though it camefromRaghav I liked the article. It augured well for my business. The article had a separate box with a list of colleges about to open in Varanasi It hadfivenames and I saw GangaTech in the list.REVOLUTION Wow I said to myself excited J had never seen GangaTechs name in print dialled Shtikkjfs number. Well done Shnklaji said Wait and see how much press we get when we open I wanted to call Raghav and ask if he could do a detailed piece on my college A reputed newspaper talking well about GangaTech could do wonders for our opening didnt have his mobile number I could easily obtain it from Aarti. However I didnt want to call hen I took the newspaper to the campus building My office .still didnt have furniture. I sat on a plastic chair and reminded myself to call the carpenter I looked at my phone contacts Aarti always came first given that her name begins with Aa am only calling her to get Raghavs number I told myself many times before I felt courageous enough to call She picked up after four rings. Hey what a surprise she said. Hi how are you I said. I did not want to exchange pleasantries. However to jump directly to my query seemed abrupt. Tin a little low but thats okay she said. How are yon It was nice chatting with you at the party I guess should have enquired why she fell low. However sidestepped i t Yeah listen do you have Raghavs number said Of course How come you want it There s an article of his T read in the paper today on education. I liked it wanted to tell him XK sure she said. He will be so happy She read out the number to me Thanks Aarii I said. Speak later then Ton don t want to know why I am low she said. When a girl asks you that youd better say yes. do. Why I said Mom and dad wont let me leave VaranasC she said. Really How will yon fly for an airline then I said. Exactly What am I supposed to become here A boat hostess Convince them I said for lack of better advice CRETAN BHAKATThey wont listen. I may have to run away Are you crazy They will come around I said Will you talk to them she said. Yeah why not Who am I Raghav will be better no said Raghav He doesnt even want me to go. Plus he is so busy at the he wont meet me let alone my parents You have no other friend Somebody from the aviation academy I said. Or maybe even your faculty You dont want to do it is it she said j u s t . . . just dont think am the best person to talk to them Fine she said. Fine means somewhere between whatever and go to heir in Girlese Okay the site engineer is calling me I lied. will speak to you later. I hung up I checked the duration of the call I had spoken to her for seven minutes and twentytwo seconds. I felt like calling her again and advising her on how to deal with her parents. Maybe I should have agreedto meet her parents after all she had chosen me from all the people sheknew. I almost pressed redial when I checked myselfOnly pain will comefrom being close to hen She belongs to Raghav andthere is no place for me in her life I scolded myself. I called Raghav. He picked up the phone immediately Hi its Gopa I said. h hi he said. Whats up buddy Thanks for coming to the party You are welcome. Hows the new job They are letting me write even though tame stuff T read your article today. Pretty good You read it Wow. Thanks You mentioned GangaTech thanks for that too Oh our research team made that table. You are about to openREVOLUTION Yes almost ready Would you like to vis it Maybe you can do a story specific to GangaTech Yeah I could Raghav said his voice hesitant Though the policy might be to not talk about specific institutions Oh in that case forget it I said. I didnt want to take a favour from him anyway But I could do a story youMeYeah a young boy from Varanasi opens a college ft is something. And in that interview we can talk about GangaTech T am more of an employee I said. MLA. Shukla is the real person right Raghav said.Li feis a trustee yes he paid to build the collegeeAndWell he arranged for the funds I said. From where Raghav said I didnt like his interrogative tone. Tie knows lots of charitable people I said. Anyway do you want to interview me Either way is fine Of course I do. When do you want to do it have an inspection next Friday After that Maybe the weekend I said Sure I will see you. Where Duinik office No Come to my office I said. I stressed the last two words I have a huge office now buddy I wanted to tell Mm. Oh sure. Wheres your campus Ten kilometres outside the city on the Lucknow Highway. You will see the board on your right I came out of the campus building I examined the threestorey structure. We had to paint it gray in the coming week. My phone rang. It was Bedi Yes Bedi sir I said. TVe lined up seven solid faculty members for interviews tomorrow. Are you freeCHETAN BHAGAT have no choice but to be free. I am on the site all day can you bring them here No way. We have to go to their houses. Three other colleges are opening in the area. They all have offers We have to lure them he said. I sighed Every day brought a new challenge. Fine will arrange a car from Shuklajis office said We reached Prof M Shrivastavas house in Ashok Nagar at eight am sharp as instructed by the retired electrical engineering professor from MIT Allahabad We had to get someone from KIT if not an IU to be the dean. We had almost struck a deal with a retired NIT Bhopal professor. However he found a better offer closer home in Indore. Prof Shrivastava was AICTE gold standard with over thirty years experience. Like all things golden he didnt come cheap Two lakhs a month I asked. Bnt we have just started Mrs Shrivastava the professors wife served us tea and poha for breakfast. She joined the negotiations. Sri Amma College has made an offer. One and a half lakhs plus a car with a driver she said Madam the university we are affiliated to controls our fee I said. Pins we are new I don t know how admissions will go I s that our problem Mrs Shrivastava asked quite correctly. Bedi jumped Into the fray. Whatever reasonable requirements you have tell us. We will accommodate he said But we have a budget I said Shrivastava put his spoon down Who are you he said to me the owners son T am the owner Gopal Mishra The college is on my land I said And Shuklaji Doesnt he decide on this He is a silent trustee I said. decide The professor looked at me for a few seconds surprised at my Mr Mishra the dean is most important I know the AICTE people. W ith me consider the inspection done Shrivastava said.R E V O L U T I O N ..... We have a setting in the AICTE too I said please understand. If I give you a high package all other members of the faculty will demand similar levels You dont have to disclose my salary he said How will we keep it hidden The accounts department will have the details I said. Pay part of it in cash Shrivastava said Silence descended over the table He had already provided a solution A more practical dean would be hard to find How much I said. Fifty per cent Maybe more he suggested. I t only saves me taxes. And nobody feels jealous of me. In fact my onpaper salary will be lower than that of the teachers We knew we had come to the right place Bed said. Tine I said. We settled for a one lakh cash seventy thousan d cheque package per month. The new dean came on board immediately. He offered to help us hire other faculty for salaries ranging from thirty to eighty thousand a month depending on experience and the degrees they possessed. Til charge ten thousand per hire as search fee apart from my salary Thats line. When can you start I said Anytime he said. will come to campus three days a week Three days I said. You are the dean of the institute. How can the college work without you I am the dean that is why three days. Else once a week is enough he said What I said. Which faculty goes to teach every day in private colleges Don t worry I will tell the AICTE inspectors i am there every day But who will manage the faculty Who will ensure that classes are held on time and the students are taught properly I said my heart beating fast I didnt know if this was how a college dean should be. l i a private college. We will manage. Tell him Bediji how it works Shrivastava grinned C R E T A N BHAKATBedi finished his cup of tea and nodded Of course. We will figure out the teaching arrangements and all later. Right now our focus is the inspection and then the admissions Later on senior students can teach firstyear students Happens in many colleges Mrs Shrivastava cleared the table We moved to the drawing room. Whats your admission strategy Shrivastava said We are advertising in ail newspapers Participating in career fairs also approaching schools and coaching classes said Approaching schools for what he asked. Well go to schools and make a presentation on our college f said. Who cares about the presentation Did you fix the principals Shrivastava said We will dont worry Bedi said. We will what I said. I hated it when Bedi didnt tell me things beforehand I will explain to you Lets go we have other meetings Bedi said and stood up Thanks sir will see you on Friday Shrivastava came to see us off at the door. When do I get my first salary he said. T will send the cash home I said. We hadfivemore faculty prospects to meet. Shtikiaji had given us an Innova car for exclusive use of the college. We proceeded to Mughal Sarai to meet a retired chemical engineering professor am so relieved the dean is done Bedi said as the car reached the highway He seemed more Mr Deal than Mr Dean to me I quipped He has worked in private colleges before He knows he is in demand Don t take his tantrums personally Bedi said. What did he mean by fix the school principals I said. The schools have a big influence on where the child goes next Many try for an IIT and NIT most dont make it. Where do they go Where I said. Thats where we come in Private colleges can fulfil your dream of becoming an engineer even if you didnt clear the entrance exam. TheR E V O L U T I O N ZQIOproblem is there are so many private colleges now. How does the student I asked the driver to decrease the temperature of the airconditioner to beat the forty degrees outside How I said They go with the school teachers and principals advice. Who else can they trust True I said. So we ask the principal to recommend our college Exactly You are smart Bedi said probably in sarcasm. Do we bribe them too said. Yes Butnever say that word especially to school principals. Anyway it is a straightforward calculation We give them ten per cent of the fee we take for every admission A defined sum doesnt sound like a bribe We give ten per cent to anyone coaching classes career fair organisers or whoever helps us fill up the college Ten per cent It is said Ton are working on the media plan right he said. My thoughts went to our media strategy then to Raghav and from there to Aartl It is amazing how the brain will connect one thought to another until it gets to where it wants to be. Bed continued to talk about how we will fill two hundred students for the first batch tuned out looking at the fields outside and remembering Aartls flowing hair as she took a sip from my drink in Raghavs balcony Life is a bitch when the only woman you can think of belongs to someone dbe. saw Raghav enter the campus from the window of my office. I had screamed at the carpenters to get my office desk and chairs finished in time. Apart from the missing visitors sofa my office had become functional The airconditioner worked. I increased the cooling to maximum to ensure Raghav noticed it. surrounded myself with files. He came and knocked on the halfopen door.lYes said and looked up.We did say two o clock right Raghav said. He wore a white shirt and blue jeans HI Raghav. Sorry f keep so busy I lose track of time sometimes Isaid He sat across me. T sat on the directors chair I wondered if he noticed how I had a far more plush chair than his He took out his notepad pen and a few printouts T did some research whatever I could find on the college You won t find much We are new said Yes but I found a lot on one of the trustees Shukla Of course he is a popular politician. But he isnt really involved in the functioning of the college Ties involved in many other things though Raghav smoothed out the printout with the questions. Tea said He nodded. I rang the bell had asked the peon to bring tea in the bone china cups we kept for special guests. Not that Raghav counted as special However I wanted him to know we had tea in fancy cups.REVOLUTION He looked around the huge twentybydghteenfeet office. wanted to ask him if anyone in his newspaper had such a big office but controlled myself. He noticed an architects model of the campus behind me Can I take a look he said. Sure said and jumped up Let me show yon all the facilities I explained the campus layout to him. The hostels arc here. We will keep adding more rooms with successive batches The classrooms and faculty offices are here in the main building we are in right now. The labs are in a separate building Ail imported equipment What will be the faculty ratio Raghav said taking frantic notes We are targeting more than one teacher per fifteen students I said which is better than the AICTE norms. One day we want to be better than BHU He looked at me Just as a goal Who else is there to compare with said He shrugged his shoulders in support. The tea arrived. I had instructed the peon to serve at least five snacks. He brought nuts biscuits samosas potato chips and cot fruits.S lhatsnot tea. Thats a meal Raghav said.Please have. We can continue the interview later I said as the peon served us. We ate in silence. I didnt want to discuss anything other than the college with him. He picked up his notepad as he ate. What kind of investment went into this college he said Lots. Engineering colleges arent cheap I said and laughed avoidingany real figures.How much exactly he said. Hard to say had the land but if you had to buy it you can imagine the prices f said. I s o t this agricultural land he said Yes you know that Raghav Remember Babas court case You managed to get it from your relatives he said. Yes but thats not going into the interview right I said C R E T A N BHAKATNo. But tell me how did this agricultural land get rezoned We applied the VNN approved I said He continued to take notes Everything Is approved I repeated perhaps too defensively. Because ofShukla he asked No I said somewhat irritated Because we followed procedures Fine How much did the college cost apart from the land he said I am not sure if I can reveal that It is alter all competitive information. But anyone who visits our campus can see it is state of the art I said More than five crores he persisted shouldnt have entered his guessing game Yes I said More than ten he said. How is the actual number relevant I said. Where did the money come from he said. From the trustees and their associates Whose associates Yours or Shuklas he said T gave the land Shuklaji arranged for the funds for the benefit of this town. We are a nonprofit trust I said.s Doyou know where the MLA arranged the funds from Raghavasked without looking up from his diary No And I dont see why I should know. It is his and his friends Are you aware of Shuklas involvement in the Ganga Action Plan scam he said No Raghav. I dont want to comment on anything other than GangaTech. If you have all the information we can end the interview Raghav put away his pen. Im sorry Yes I am done. Dont worry I will do a balanced piece Thanks I will see you out We walked together to the campus gate. He had come on an old scooter that belonged to his dad. I could have sent ray car to pick you up I said. I t is too hot. TVs fine. I have to go to many places he said and put his helmet on.REVOLUTION cDoyou miss engineering said my first general question to him.Not really Never became one I guess he said felt the time was right to deliver my final punch. You are from BHU. Youd look great on our faculty list. Want to join I said Yes could hire him BHU may not have taken me but I could take their graduates.MeFaculty No way. Besides I have a j o b he said and sat on thescooter You dont have to come much. Help me with the inspections and maybe come once a week I said. He was about to start his scooter but stopped midway He mulled over my words. We pay well Maybe more than your newspaper added. He smiled and shook his head Why riot said irked by his easy rejection T cant be part of a corrupt enterprise he saklWhatVIt is Siuiklas college It Is mine I protested I know you will run it but he is behind it right So How can you call us corrupt We haven t even opened yet I t s built with money made by corrupt practices I have worked my ass off for three years Raghav. Three years Sundays included. How can you make a statement like that He is accused of stealing twenty crores from the Gnga Action Flan Government money meant to clean our river I t is an accusation Not proven I said. Right after that he made many property investments including this college Cant believe you didnt see through it. How can a politician have so much money He comes from a humble background Can you prove wrongdoing I said. Hot yet But are you sure he didnt do anything he queried I couldnt control myself anymore. You are jealous I said Whatr C R E T A N BHAKATYou are jealous that I am doing well I am not supposed to do well right After all my AIEEE rank was lower than yours. Isnt it Mr JEE Easy buddy This is not personal he said and kickstarted his scooiteiLThen what is it Mr Reporter Its my job to figure out the truth thats all Before I could respond he zoomed off. He left behind a cloud of dust that stung my eyes more than anything ever had in the past year.The day of the AICTE inspection felt like an exam day Our faculty of twenty reached the campus at a.m. Sweepers scrubbed the floors till the last minute. The IT specialist ensured that the desktops in the computer room worked. We had arranged a dinner at Taj Ganga for the inspection committee. Shuklaji had promised me hed come but backed out at the last minute due to an urgent rural visit Sweat beads formed on my forehead. made the fifth trip to the campus gate to check if the Stand straight I hollered at the security guard and salute all guests Relax Director Gopal Dean Shrivastava said T will handle them They arrived only at eleven Ashok Sharma our juniormost faculty member waited with bouquets at the main building entrance. The head of the inspection committee shook my hand T am fhule Yadav exprofessor from NIT Delhi T am Gopal Mishra promoter and director of the college. Meet Dean Shrivastava exdirector of NIT Allahabad I said. Yadav and Shrivastava exchanged glances sizing each other up like boxers in a ring We walked to my office and sat down on the new sofas that smelt of varnish. NIT Allahabad Yadav asked You had a Barua in Electrical He went to Stanford later Yes Shrivastava said hired himBaruawas my student Yadav said and slapped his thigh.REVOLUTION Suddenly the lights went out Everyone sighed as darkness engulfed us. We had power supply issues in the nearby villages. We had no electricity for six hours every afternoon. We have a generator I said and went to tell the peon to switch it imThe office was turning stuffy Should we go outside said one middleaged member of the inspection team. Any niinufe now sir I said. The tubelight in my office blinked as power came back on How many lathe machines are there in your machining lab asked an inspector. Eight Shrivastava said We will take a round later Shrivastava sin why walk around in the heat Yadav said Your team member asked a question sir Shrivastava said. Everyone turned to the inspector who had asked the lathe machine question You are Shrivastava said Mr Bhansali said the inspector. Mr Bhansali why dont we all move to my office for courserelated questions Unless you need the promoter You look young Bhansali said to me am young I said. What are your qualifications he said have built this college said and have hired the best faculty But. Bhansali said as Shrivastava cut him Lets go sir. I will answer everything Shrivastava said and escorted them out When everyone was out Shrivastava came back into my office. Bhansali is new The other six wont say a word Lunch is coming right Yes the caterer is already here said Good And the packets Hacfeerf Gopai do I have to explain it This is AICTE Gh I said. You mean the envelopes. Of course I have them readyCHETAN BHAGATGood. Give it to them after dessert How much Two for Yadav and twentyfive each for the rest I said Make it fifty for Bhansali Shrivastava said Whats for dessert Moong daal halwa said My favourite Prof Shrivastava said and leftWe had hooked a private room in Taj Ganga for the AICTE inspection dinner. We had also invited our entire faculty and senior government officials who had helped us in the past. They came with families. This party of a hundred people burnt another hole in GangaTechs pocket. We hadnt earned a rupee of revenue yet. We had spent six crores already on construction equipment faculty and of course fixing government officials. However Shuklaji didnt seem to care Relax we will recover the money Shuklaji said. He handed me a whisky with soda. I scanned the room We have paid bribes to at least thirty people in this room said Shuklaji laughed. What have we done wrong We only wanted to open a college I Said. .. Tfs okay Shukla ji said. Tf we had a straightforward and dean system these professors would open their own colleges. Bluechip companies and software firms could open colleges The system is twisted they dont want to touch it. That is where we come in When will we make money paid five lakhs today for the inspection Pay them some more Shuklaji said. Who Ihe inspectors Why I said Shrivastava sir said it is enough. We will get the approval in a weekREVOLUTION . want them to not only clear the college but also say great things about GangaTech Shuklaji said. I n writing I said Yes which we will use for marketing. Ten thousand more to the minions fifty more to the main guy. f l l arrange the cash He took out his phone and made a call Shuklaji and I went to the dinner buffet We filled our plates with foods and came to one comer of the room The cash will arrive in an hour he told m eWhy do you tryst me so mack Shuklaji. I could steal your money You don t have a family Whom would you steal for he said.A he AICTE approval came on time as promised by Prof Shrivastava. We had one final step before we opened for admissions. We needed the state university affiliation. Mangesh Tiwari the vicechancellor had sat on our application for months We were at ShuHajis place Affiliation is a simple job. We are offering him double the market rate. Mangesh is turning senile Bedi said. How much does he want Shuklaji asked I t s not about the money. He doesnt like us. Doesnt even take our calls Bedi said. What is the solution said Use some contacts. Nonpolitical if possible he is a college batchmate of our DM Bedi said. know the DM s daughter. Old school friend said Well do whatever it takes I want admissions to open next week.

She wore a mauve chikan salwarkameez. Her father had bought it for her from Lucknow. She removed her white dupatta and kept it aside. The waiter placed her milk shake on the table She put her lips to the straw without touching the overflowing glass with her hands. often spill this I better be careful she said. Wisps of her hair brushed the table as she sipped her drink. The entire cafe checked her out. We should totally do this more often she said coffee meetings.

He interviewed me for his paperWhat for she said.Local boy starts college Its true Quite an achievement Yeahj for a loser like roeIdidnt say that she said.

Trainee today officer tomorrow maybe GM of the hotel some day. You are smart.

You wouldnt have got the job otherwise I said Should I take itV Why not Quit if you dont like it What does Raghav say Meaning T haven t met him since the offer I called him but he said I should do whatever I want He is in some village this week for a story I t s good for both of you if you stay here said Well he didnt say that at all T am sure he realises it T dont think he cares so much about my issues unless I am involved tn a corruption scandal she said.

When can see GangaTech she said. Two more weeks I said T promise. Its almost done We walked to her car.REVOLUTION laughed I cried It is so nice to meet you Aarti said Same here I didnt cry though I said She laughed again. She hugged me and held me slightly longer than usual Old friends are old friends Gopal Boyfriends and all are line but they never understand you like old friends can I hated the word friends but didnt say anything just waved goodbye. My phone rang. Bedi. The VC has called us for a meeting. I h e phone call from the DM worked They know each other from childhood he said Old friends are old friends I said.JTor GangaTechs opening I wore a suit for the first time in my life. I supervised the decorations We slept in my office the night before. We had turned three classrooms into admission centres. I stayed up to ensure we had forms pens and information booklets. Shuklaji had gone all out too. He had managed to convince the Chief Minister to come and inaugurate the college. Two state ministers would accompany him. The security officials of the politicians had already visited us the day before. Since we didnt have an auditorium yet we had erected a makeshift podium inside a tent for the speeches Two thousand invites sent sir to all prominent families in Varanasi Ajay from the chemical engineering faculty told me. We had promised lunch Hence we expected at least half of the invitees to turn up. Given the distance we had arranged four buses for the general public and a dozen cars to ferry the media to and fro had spent ten lakhs on fullpage ads in leading city newspapers three days in a row. You only get one shot at a launch Shuklaji wanted the city to know he had built an institution Work ended at am I lay down on the office sofa for a power nap before the function ShukJajfs call woke me up at sixthirty rubbed my eyes disoriented. Good morning Shuklaji said. Did you see the newspaper realised he must have seen the fullpage ads and called in excitement. After years of waiting finally the day had come. No I am in campus The paper hasnt arrived yet I said. How did this happen Shuklaji said.IEREVOLUTION I wondered why he didnt sound happy. Maybe he is not a morning person I thought The ads look nice dont they Not the ads you idiot I am talking about the article in Dainik Shuklaji had never called me names before. Sure I worked for him. But he had never raised his voice at me until now What article I said my hand going to my sleepdeprived throbbing temples Ttead the paper and call me Okay How do the ads look I only heard a click in response. I shouted for the peon and asked htm to fetch all the newspapers. In m hour I had them on my desk. Every paper had our Mipage colour ad. Hie campus photograph looked beautiful I saw my name at the bottom of the ad. Shuklaji s harsh words rang in my head. I flipped through Dainik. On page six I found the article. The headline said New engineering college opens In city with corruption money What the fuck said to myself as I read further. Raghav Kashyap Staff Reporter I couldnt believe he had done this. Hie first few lines seemed harmless. The city o fVaranasi also called the City of Learning can boast of another engineering college of its own. The GngaTeeh College of Engineering set in a fifteenacre campus on the Lucknow Highway opens its gates for admissions this weekend Raghav had indeed mentioned the facilities we offered the faculty profile the branches of engineering available and the selection process The halfpage article also carried a picture of Shuklaji and me. I had never seen my picture in a newspaper. However couldht savour the moment as I continued to read the article C R E T A N BHAKATInterestingly MLA Raman La Shukla is one of the trustees of GangTeeh He has helped fund the college Shukla also owns land around the GangaTech campus estimated to cost between five and ten crores. Where did Shukla obtain these funds from Incidentally he floated the college three years ago around the same time that his name came up in the Ganga Action Plan scam. Is this college an attempt to clean up his reputation People come to the Ganga to clean their sins. Is Shukla trying to clean away his sins against Ganga Fuck your I said as I finished the article I crumpled the newspaper This could not be happening to us. Not on the day of admissions. Not on any day Shuklaji called again. hesitated but picked up I saw it I said How the hell did this happen Who is this behenchod reporter Raghav He really interviewed you l i e is my ... f friend ... from school said stammering Tie had promised a balanced piece. This is balanced He has shoved it up my ass. am really sorry Shuklaji. Dont worry other papers dont have this storyf Datnik is the biggest and most influential The CM has already cancelled his visit. What I said shocked Who will inaugurate the college We have a stone plaque in his name dont know The peon can inaugurate it for all I care Shuklaji said Please be calm Shuklaji I said Really we have to find someone in the next three hours. The M I A took a deep breath The state minister for education is still coming. He can inaugurate it And the plaque Put a sticker on it GopaL Do I have to tell you everythingREVOLUTION A Sorry Shuklaji I will fix it I said I began a round of followups. Most of the invitees confirmed their presence. A free lunch beats corruption allegations any day May I come in sir I heard a female voice as I finished a call I looked upAarttr Am I disturbing you she said. T am early She had come at nine an hour before the scheduled inauguration. Even in my stressed state I noticed she had dressed up for the occasion. She wore a bottle green salwarkameez with a purple and gold border. I continued to stare at her my mouth half open May I come in Director sir she said. Huh Yeah of course I said Wow you l o o k J What she said. Too look so formal I said Stunning is what wanted to say Oh thought you might say I look nice Thais obvious Aarti Whats obvious You always look good I said Yeah dont hear that so much these days Why Your boyfriend doesnt say it asked with a sting in my voice thoughts of Raghav s article not leaving my head. She sighed Unless I dress up in newsprint dont think he would .notfcel I smiled And started to check the list of school principals to see if I had missed anyone. You seem busy Aarti said. Should I wait outside I would have never let Aarti go but I had tons of calls to make. Will you be okay outside said. Yes mom is here. Dad couldnt come. He is on tour Oh I said. Let me wish her at least We walked outside. Her mother was sitting in the front row one of the first guests in the tent Hello aunty I said my hands folded. Congratulations Gopal What a lovely campus she said.CHBTAM BEAGATI t s still under construction I said gesturing at a waiter to bring tea and snacks. Dont worry about us Aarti said. You do your function. Attend to all the highprofile guests. She hugged me before I left. I noticed her mothers eyes on me. folded my hands once more and excused myself. The inauguration ceremony went off smoothly though without the CM the event lost some of its sheen The state education minister unveiled the college plaque his name stuck over the CMs on the black granite stone. There were murmurs among the media members regarding the CMs absence The CM had to cancel in the last minute due to a crisis Shuklaji said as he came on stage. He kept his speech to less than a minute. The press scrambled to ask questions. They all wanted to talk about the Dainik article However the MLA dodged them all from podium to gate My apologies no questions today. I have to visit villages. The farmers need me. Mr Gopal Mishra will take it from here Within minutes he had left the campus in his car. He called me from the highway T want to speak to the bloody editor of Dainikl he said. Sure I will set it up I said. By the way the admission forms are going well. Do the bastards know how many ads we give them he went on Shuklaji on the admissions But he had already cut the call said.w.We hoped to fill the remaining seats with an ad campaign.cWewant to advertise all year I told the marketing head of VaranasiTimes We expect a bigger discount I had spent the whole day doing the rounds of newspapers to book more ads. I sat in the office of Amar Trivedi marketing head of VaranasiTimesREVOLUTION Why dont you make m your media partner he saidWhatsthat I said.For a little extra fee we publish positive articles about your college We get news yon get an Image It is a winwin partnership he said. How do I know they will be positive said. Once bitten twice shy You send us the articles Amar said. asked him to send me a forma proposal After Vamnasi Timess I went to Bansphatak to visit the Dainik office Welcome Gopalji Sailesh Gupta the sales manager at Dainilc greeted me at the building entrance I Hashed him a curt smile. We went to his office. What will you have sir he said. I shook my head. Tea Coffee Articles full of lies said. What he said. Sailesh signed you the biggest cheque among all the places we advertised in And what did you do On the day of our launch Sailesh understood my context and shifted his gaze. have five lakhs more to spend next week. Tel me why I should not make Varanasi Times happy and give them this waved the trusts chequebook at him Gopal bhai Sailesh said in a low voice what are you saying We are the number one newspaper So You fuck us Gopal bhai didnt do it College made with corrupt money You have made money from us loo I t is the editorial They are stupid impractical people Sailesh said. I banged my fist on the table. want to meet your editorinchief. If you want me to book any ads after this I said Sailesh glanced at my chequebook. He stood up Let s go he said. I followed him to the editorial floor.ISO CtfETAN BHAGATIn his glass cabin Ashok Kumar the editorinchief was m a meeting with some subeditors. Sailesh went in the subeditors came out Sailesh signalled for me to enter Ashok scanned me from tip to toe. You are from MLA Shuklas office he said. T am the director of GangaTech College said and offered my hand. He shook it in a cursory manner and asked me to sit down T saw the fullpage ads Ashok began looking a bit puzzled about my presence in his cabin. Did you see the article you did on us I said am sure must have. Who did it Ashok said. He put on his spectacles and turned to his computer to search Sir may not remember the reporter Sailesh told me Should we Raghav Kashyap wrote it said. The new hire Ashok said upbeat for the first time. He quickly located the article on his computer. He turned the monitor towards us. This one I nodded. T must congratulate the reporter. Hes new yet his stories are getting I f you write nonsense you will get noticed I said. What happened Saileshji. Why is your client so upset We have done a halfpage profile on their college Ashok said. Why the last two paras And the headline butted in. What Ashok said and skimmed the article again. Oh the corruption stuff. What is the big deal in that It affects our image I said bringing down both my palms forcefully on the table Ashok didnt appreciate my display of emotion. He stared at me. I removed my hands from the table. Tf you are so concerned about image why did you open a college with MLA Shukla Ashok said. Sailesh realised this wasnt going wellREVOLUTION Sir GangaTech is expected to be our biggest account Sailesh said. So we should stop reporting news in a fair manner Ashok said. The allegations have not been proved I said. A threeyearold dead issue is brought out on the day of the opening. Is that fair Ashok sir lets talk in private for two minutes Sailesh said. I stood outside the office as they spoke. I looked around. I asked a peon where Raghav Kashyap sat. I saw his tiny cubicle. It occupied less space than the sofa in my office. I saw Raghav. He was typing furiously on his computer unaware of the world around him. Sailesh called me back in. Dont worry it is all settled. Ashok sir will speak to the MLA directly. We will sort it out. Please lets continue our association Sailesh said. Okay I said. What about the reporter What about him Sailesh said. He is a trainee. I want him to apologise to me I said. Sailesh looked at Ashok. Thats up to him Ashok said. He picked up the phone and asked his secretary to send Raghav in. Five minutes later Raghav knocked on the door. Sir you called me Raghav said then saw me. Hey Gopal. You here You guys know each other Ashok said one eyebrow raised. He interviewed me I said. Raghav seemed surprised by my terse statement. He realised I didnt want to establish any prior connection. Whats the matter Raghav said as he noticed the serious mood in the room. Sailesh recounted our earlier discussion. Apologise Raghav said. Gopal you want me to apologise to you Do you guys know each other from before Ashok said catching on to the undercurrents. We went to the same school I said. And sat at the same desk. Close friends Raghav said. Why dont you tell them that C R E T A N BHAKATWhy dont I tell them you took my girl you asshole I wanted to say. Or that you are so jealous of my success that you planted a stinker article These corruption allegations are unfounded. And there is no need to mention them in a college profile I said. I had to be balanced Raghav said. Shukla is a known crook. Nonsense I said my voice loud. Mr Gopal lets not raise our voice. Raghav you dont have to be an activist in every story Ashok said Sir I hardly wrote anything. I didnt probe the building violations in the college. There are no violations. All our plans are approved I said. And how did Shukla get these approvals Anyway I didnt mention any of that Even the Ganga Action Plan is old news Raghav Ashok said. Unless you have new solid evidence no point repeating it. We cant keep spoiling someones name. Raghav ran hisfingersthrough his hair distractedly. Fine I wont do it until Ifindsomething solid. May I leave now You havent apologised to Gopal sir Sailesh said. GangaTechs our client Editorial only apologises for genuine errors Raghav said. Or if your chief editor tells you to Sailesh said his voice firm. Raghav looked at Ashok. Ashok kept quiet. Sir how can you ..Raghav began. Raghav let s get it over with. I have to sign off the next edition in one hour Ashok said turning back to his computer screen. Silence for ten seconds or so. Im sorry Raghav said on a sigh. Its okay I said but Raghav had already stomped out of the room.crI ou and Raghav had an argument Aarti said. She had called me late at night her preferred time. He told you I said. I suggested that the three of us meet up and he almost bit my head off she said. No way I like your head I said. The hotel opens next week. I thought I would take permission and show you guys the place beforehand. It is so beautiful she said. You can show him separately I said. What happened Aarti said. You met him right Why doesnt anybody tell me anything It was workrelated don t worry. All settled now. Tf you say so. Can you come around tomorrow Of course. Good night Director sahebI waited for Aarti at the Ramada Hotel entrance. The security wouldnt let me in. Aarti arrived and flashed her staff card and I followed her in. She wore a maroon Banarasi sari her uniform. Aarti Pratap Pradhan Guest Relations Trainee her badge said. Wow you look so different I said. Different Formal Is that all you say she mocked. No ... You look great. But I didnt expect to see you in a sari I said. Didnt expect what That your stupid classmate from school could get a real job she wiggled her eyebrows hands on hips. C R E T A N BHAKATYeah. You are quite stupid I pretended to agree which made her punch my arm playfully. We entered the hotel lobby. Construction workers were using noisy polishing machines on the already shiny Italian marble. Smell of paint pervaded the air. She took me to a restaurant with plush velvet chairs. This will be our bar Toxic The hotel would ensure that even as people visited the city to wash their sins theyd commit new ones. We walked around the hotel to see the rest of the facilities. So why wont people tell me anything she said. What I said. What happened between Raghav and you The college didht like a story the newspaper did. He apologised. End of story I gave her a twominute summary of what had happened making her swear that she would never tell Raghav I told her. She told me she hadnt even told Raghav she was meeting me so there was no question of telling him anything. Thats what human relationships are about selective sharing and hiding of information to the point of crazy confusion. We found ourselves in an ethnictheme restaurant. Aangan for Indian cuisine she explained. She took me to the gym next. I saw the treadmills with TVs attached to them. Imported I said. She nodded. Sometimes I feel so guilty she said. Girls can handle simultaneous multitopic conversations with ease. Why I spoilt your friendship with Raghav she said. Thats not true I said. She sat down on a benchpress. I took a balancing ball and used it as a stool. All three of us used to befriends in our childhood. What happened she said her eyes filling up. Life I said. Life happened.REVOLUTION Without me things wouldnt be so bad between the two of you she said. cNo thats not true. I didnt deserve you. Raghav had nothing to do with it I said. Never say that Aarti said her voice echoing in the empty gym. Its not that you dont deserve me. You are a great guy Gopal. And we click so well. cBut you dont feel that way about me I know I know. I am hungry. Where are we having lunch Its not that she said. What Its not like that with girls. It s sometimes about timing and sometimes about how much you push. didnt push enough for a relationship I said. You pushed too much she said and wiped her eye. I didnt know if I should console her. One she belonged to someone else. Two we sat at her workplace. I picked up a pound dumbbell instead. I found it heavy. However I pretended to lift it easily in front of Aarti. Raghav could probably lift twice as much I thought. Why did I always compete with Raghav on every damn thing I am sorry I said. Im sorry if I put too much pressure. You came at a time when I didnt feel ready for anything. You wanted it too much. You wanted to lean on me. I didn t think I could be a strong enough support What is this My performance evaluation day I said. I did a set of five with the dumbbell before keeping it down. I am just saying ... I dont know why. I guess I really need to talk. Or need to be heard I said. We looked at each other. Yes exactly that. How well you know me Gopal. Too well I said and smiled. You want to see the rooms before we have lunch she said Sure. Where are we eating I said. C R E T A N BHAKATAt the staff canteen she said. We took stainlesssteel elevators to the thirdfloor.She had a master key card to every room. I am not supposed to bring anyone to the hotel by the way she confided. So I said wondering if it meant we should leave. I am telling you how important you are. I am risking my job for you. If they fire you I will hire you. Our eyes met. We burst into laughter. We had not shared such a moment in years. We used to laugh like this in school in sync and for the silliest of things a burping kid in class her mimicking the teachers me pretending to sleep during History period. She opened room number . I had never seen anything so luxurious in my whole life. Cool I said. Isnt it She sat on the large bed with its six cushions of bright red silk. This bed is heaven Sit and see. Are you sure I said. Sit no she said. We sat next to each other me on the edge of the bed. Its nice I said as if I was a mattress inspector by profession. Its more comfortable lying down she said. I looked at her aghast She saw my expression and started to laugh holding her stomach. I am not saying lets she said. Since when did you become so serious We spent the next twenty minutes playing around with light switches and bathroom taps. I had never been with her in a solitary place like this. It was going to my head. And I sensed a slight tension in the air. Maybe the tension was only on my side. Let s go I checked my watch. I had to be back in the campus soon. Okay she said and shut the washbasin tap. We stepped out of the room. A man in a crisp new suit saw us come out.REVOLUTION Aarti he said surprised. The colour vanishedfromAartis face. Sir she said. I read the tag on the mans suit. Binayak Shastri Banquet Manager. What are you doing here he said Sir she said this is Mr Gopal Mishra. He is a client We havent opened yet he said still suspicious. Hi I said offering him my hand. I am the director of the GangaTech group of colleges He shook my hand. We are thinking of doing a college event here I said. We walked towards the elevator. I was hoping he would ask no further questions when he said What kind of event A dinner for the top companies that we call for placement I said. Aarti avoided eye contact with everyone. Sure we will be happy to assist you Binayak said as he handed me his card. I guessed that our staffcanteen lunch plan had to be dropped. I am running late but my team will get in touch with you I said as we came to the lobby. Aarti gave me a professional smile and disappeared behind the reception desk. Binayak chose to wait with me till my car arrived. How come you wanted to see the rooms Binayak asked. We will have guest faculty. Maybe from abroad I said. At that moment thankfully my driver drove into the porch.ver the next two months we managed to fill a hundred and eighty seats out of the two hundred in ourfirstbatch. For the first time I actually handed money to Shuklaji s accountant. Many students paid their fee in cash. Farmers kids in particular brought money in gunny bags with bundles of notes accumulated over the years. Make my son an engineer a farmer pleaded with folded hands. It made life so much easier. For the job and dowry market a B.Tech degree never hurt. Dean Shrivastava and his gang of twenty faculty members took care of the classes. I kept myself busy with projects such as getting the hostel mess operational hiring new staff and ensuring that the remaining construction work continued as per schedule. I had a limited social life. Once a week I had dinner with faculty members mostly to discuss work. A couple of times I ended up at Shuklajis place. You are the director of the institute. How can you still stay in your tiny old house he said one day after too much whisky. The faculty bungalow will be ready soon. I sleep in the office most of the days I said. Aarti however had come back into my life as the only nonwork person I spent time with. Ramada opened she joined work and sat prettily at the Guest Relations desk in the lobby. On herfirstday of work I sent her a box of chocolates andflowers.Maybe I shouldnt have but I felt the day was important to her. I made sure the bouquet had only white roses for friendship no red ones.Hey thanx. Really sweeeet of ul came her SMS.I read the message fifty times. Ifinallycomposed a reply U r welcome.For a gr future career woman.REVOLUTION She replied after ten minutes. Why r u being so nice to me I had no answer. I used a womens trick. When in doubt send a smiley. I sent three. She messaged Meet up after work p.m. CCD Sure I replied promptly. I drove down from the campus to Sigra to meet her. She told me about her day at work. She had helped settle five Germans into the hotel arranged three cars for a tenmember Japanese delegation and sent a surprise birthday cake to an American in his room. She seemed happy. I didnt think she missed being an air hostess. So we met today. What do you do in the evenings otherwise she said. Not much. Stay on campus. Work I said. Thats horrible. What about friends Aarti said. I shrugged. I have colleagues in the college. Thats company enough She patted my hand. You should have friends. Look at me I have you. What about Raghav I said. He works late at the newspaper. He has no time . s h e said withdrawing her hand. She did not tell me how Raghav would feel about our regular meetings which is what I had really asked. She only told me Raghav would not find out. You have to meet friends after work. She sounded like she was convincing herself. T probably bore you to death with my hotel stories but.. You never bore me. Even if you dont say a word I said. With that Aarti and I became friendswhomeetafterwork. We met twice a week sometimes thrice. We ate at new restaurants visited cafes took walks in the Ravidas Park and occasionally watched movies. We had some unspoken rules. We didnt have long chats on the phone and mostly texted each other. We never visited the past or talked about touchy topics. I would never touch her even though she would C R E T A N BHAKATsometimes hold my arm midconversation. At movie theatres we would enter and leave separately. Thats what boys and girls did in Varanasi anyway. When Raghav called I would quietly step away so I couldnt hear her. Finally when Raghav finished work she would leave. I couldnt figure out why Id started to hang out with her. I had become a buffer until her boyfriend got free from work. I guess I wanted a break from work too. And of course when it came to Aarti my reasons went for a toss anyway. So Raghav has no idea we meet I asked her one day. She shook her head and wiped her coffee moustache.Raghav stayed out of my life after the inauguration day debacle. However he couldnt stay off his old tricks for long. VaranasiNagar Nigam eats builder cheats Raghav Kashyap Staff ReporterI woke up to this headline a month after we opened. He often wrote about blackmarketeer ration shop owners LPG cylinders sold illegally the RTO officer taking bribes and other routine Indian things nobody gives a fuck about. I would have ignored this article too had he not mentioned GangaTech. I skimmed a few lines. The article said Surprisingly the inappropriate approvals and the resultant illegal construction are right there in front of our eyes. Unlike other corruption cases where the wrongdoing is hidden like the Ganga Action Plan scam here the proof is for all to see. Farms are turned into colleges which then flout all norms to construct as much as possible. Colleges will soon have malls nextdoor. Politicians meant to protect us and prevent all this are often the culprits. This is not all the city has new hotels residential towers and office buildings where the VNN has takenREVOLUTION its cut. We have proof to compare the vast difference between what is allowable and what VNN approved .. A box next to the article listed the controversial approvals. I read the list . . . The VCON apartment building a tenstorey tower on a lowflying zone. Hotel Vento construction of which has taken over a neighbourhood park. GangaTech College Farmland mysteriously approved. College buildings constructed beyond permissible floorspace index. threw the newspaper away. I had improved my relations with Shuklaji with great difficulty. I had told him that the reporter had apologised to me and that this would never happen again. I knew Raghav was taking revenge for the sorry that day. He must have obtained GangaTechs building plan from his shady sources in VNN. I took out my phone. Before I could call him however Shuklaji called me. I dont know how this happened I said. Behenchods these Dainik people are Shuklaji said. This reporter has to stop ... I said. Its not the reporter. The opposition must be doing this. T dont know sir. Or maybe someone in my own party Jealous bastards wanting to spoil my name. I dont think so sir. What It is the reporter. I know him from before. Hes the crusaderactivist types. Plus he had to apologise to me. He is taking revenge. Who Raghav Kashyap the name is there in the article. TT fuck his happiness Shuklaji said. C R E T A N BHAKATShould I call him I said. Dont. Ill speak to his seniors. I said What about the article. Does it affect us If VNN calls direct them to me Shuklaji said.No VNN officials called. Instead they came straight to my college. The officials didnt come alone they came with two bulldozers. Students peeped from classroom windows as the sounds of the earthmover disrupted classes. I came running to the gate. Open the gates we have come for demolition said a man wearing cheap sunglasses and a yellow plastic helmet. What I said. We have orders said the VNN official. He took out a folded piece of paper from his pocket. My heart beat fast. What will you demolish The main building. Theres illegal construction here he said his tone defiant. The harsh morning sun hit our faces. Can we talk I said. He shook his head. I took out my phone. I called Shuklaji He didnt answer. This is MLA Shuklas college. What is your name sir I said. Rao. I am Amrit Rao. I don t care whether you say MLA or PM. I coaxed him to be patient for ten minutes. He turned the ignition off on the bulldozers. I asked the peon to get soft drinks with ice for everyone. I continued to try Shuklajis number. He answered at the eighth attempt. What is it Gopal I had to call the CM. These stupid articles are the biggest headaches. Sir we have bulldozers here. WhatShuklaji said. I handed the phone to Rao who repeated his mission to the MLA. However he became silent as the MLA spoke at the other end. RaoREVOLUTION stepped aside to have a lengthy animated conversation with Shuklaji for ten minutes. Rao returned my phone. Here Shuklaji wants to speak to you. Sir I said still dazed. How much cash do you have in the office Shuklaji wanted to know Not sure sir. Around two lakhs in the safe. Give it to him. Put the notes in an empty cement bag topped up with sand. Yes sir I said. His colleagues should not see it. He has a solid reputation. Okay sir. And he has to break something. He cant go back without demolition pictures. What Is there anything partially constructed you dont need immediately Sir the students are going to see the demolition I said. No choice. This reporter friend of yours has kicked us right in the... Hes no longer a friend sir I said. Hes fucked. Anyway tell me what can be broken easily and will cost the least to fix The machining lab. We can put the machines somewhere else I said. Do that. Then draw a cross sign with chalk outside the lab. Let them do the rest. Dont forget the cement bag. Shuklaji hung up. I signalled the security guard to open the gates. Rao gave me an oily smile.I cant do a movie today. I have to leave in ten minutes Aarti frowned as she stepped into my Innova. I had come to pick her up at the hotel with tickets for the . p.m. show of Rock On. Can you get a refund I tore up the tickets. Gopal she said. What are you doing You shouldnt have bought tickets without asking me. Why are you distraught Its about Raghav. I have to be with him. What I said. Dont talk about Raghav. Whose rule is that Mr Mishra Mine. But I want to know why you are cancelling the plan Til tell you. Can you drop me home DM s bungalow I told the driver. Keep it to yourself okay Aarti said. He told me not to tell anyone. I can trust you right Do I have to answer that I said. Fine. Raghav lost his job she said What I said. A surge of warm joy ran through me. Tm shocked. Dainik considered him a star reporter Aarti said. Did they give a reason I said. The reason was sitting next to her. I dont know. He didnt say. He just said the management asked him to leave Recession I said in a mockconcerned voice. They cut staff in tough times to save costsREVOLUTION How much can you save by firing a trainee reporter And Dainik is doing well The car reached Aartis home. Is he at your place I said as she stepped out. She shook her head. Til go meet him. I wanted to come home and change. How did he sound Upset I said. Very very angry Aarti said and rushed off.I shouldnt have called him. However I couldnt resist calling Raghav at midnight. I wanted to see if he would remain defiant in his unemployed state. I held a tall whisky glass in my right hand and the phone in my left. I thought he wouldnt take my call. However he picked it up soon enough. Do you need another apology were his first words. Hi Raghav I said my voice calm. How are things Quite good. What is bothering you that you called Dont be upset with me I said. You only get upset with people you care about Raghav said. You cared about your job. Bye Gopal he said. I told you not to write shit about us I said. I dont need to ask you how to do my job. I took a big gulp of whisky. Oh yeah how can you BHU passout taking advice from an uneducated man like me. He remained silent as I filled my glass again. The whisky made me feel more confident than ever before. Its not about education Gopal. Its the person you have become. I cant believe it Rich. SuccessfulHard to believe huh The person who cleared JEE is unemployed. C R E T A N BHAKATTil find a job Gopal. And tell that MLA of yours just because he could get a trainee fired from Dainik doesnt mean he can silence the truth. I could give you a job Raghav. Want to work for me I only heard a click in response.Revolution Aarti said chin in hands and both her elbows on the table. We had come to the Ramada Hotel coffee shop. It was an offday for her. She could visit the restaurants as a customer in regular civilian clothes. Waiters smiled at her in recognition and she greeted them back. Ever since Raghav lost his job she hadnt met me too often as she wanted to be with him. Finally on her weekly holiday I coaxed her to meet up. Whats that I said. Doht ask questions. Revolution when I say this to you what comes to your mind What could it be She blinked a couple of times as she waited for me to reply. I noticed how appealing she looked even in a simple orange Tshirt and black jeans. A new restaurant Is Ramada opening one She laughed. Whats so funny I said. What is this Revolution Its a new newspaper. Raghavs. His own newspaper I said startled. Yeah. He decided not to take up another job. Even if he wanted Raghav could not get a media job in Varanasi at least in the top papers. Shuklaji had informed all the major editors. Aarti of course didnt know this. She didnt even know why Raghav had lost his job. Raghav said Dainik didnt give him a reason. Is that fair she said. Theres politics in organisations. He will learn to fit in I said. He doesnt want to fit in. He wants to change journalism. Give it some teeth Aarti said.REVOLUTION We ordered our coffee. Alongside the waiters also gave us freshly baked cookies and muffins. Did we order all this I said. Contacts she said and winked at me. How can he start a newspaper I said. You need money. Its not money. Its the content that matters Aarti said and took a sip. A sliver of foam was left behind on her lip. Aarti you really believe this You are a practical girl. Its fine Gopal. You opened a college. Why cant he do this I had a backer MLA Shukla who had cash and connections. He hates him. Raghav says Shukla is the most corrupt leader Varanasi has ever had Aarti said. Thats speculation I said. Is there any successful person who hasnt been criticised Shukla is highprofile and rising. People are trying to bring him down. Okay can we please not discuss politics Aarti said. The political gene ended in my family with my grandfather. You could join I said. People still remember your grandfather She raised her hand and pumped her fist to make a mockslogan gesture. Vote for me I will give you free cookies with coffee. She smiled. No thanks. I am happy in Ramada I smiled back. Anyway so how exactly is he going to start his ... revolving what Revolution . Thats his goal. That India must have a fullblown revolution by . Power will be with the youth. We will dismantle the old corrupt system and put a new one in place. And hes going to do that from Varanasi I sounded as skeptical as I felt. Yes of course. Kids from big cities are cushioned against the system. They have decent colleges get good breaks. The revolution has to start from a small city Hes definitely got you on board I said. What better place to start than the city that cleanses she said. C R E T A N BHAKATShe spoke in an enthusiastic voice. Maybe this was what she liked about Raghav. His passionate approach to life even if it was outlandish and fantastic. Girls dont like reality that much. Or practical questions. How does this newspaper work Who pays for the printing paper and promotion while the revolution comes She sobered quickly. So it isnt exactiy a newspaper to start with. It is like a newsletter. Just one big sheet. Okay I egged her on On one side of the paper will be matrimoniais. People from Varanasi love fixing marriages. So he will put ads for local brides and grooms on that side. Free at first and charge later. Maybe some job ads too. Why wouldnt people advertise in established newspapers Revolution ads will cost much lower and will be extremely local. You canfindbrides and grooms down your own street. I nodded. On the other side Raghav will do local news stories. And since it is not a proper newspaper he can be edgier and do more sting operations He loves doing that I agreed. So thats it. Printing costs are low as there is only one big sheet to begin with. He will contact temples for the initial ads so lets see. Do you like the name I shrugged my shoulders. She bit into a muffin. Everyone has their thing Gopal Aarti said her mouth full. You have your college. This is his. It will never make money I said. So She waved her muffin at me. Money isnt everything. Easy to say that when you are eating cakes in a fivestar hotel I said. She grinned and kept her muffin down. T like money I said. Nothing wrong with that. My deal is simple. Money or revolution everyone should follow their heart. Sometimes your heart can lead you to a dead end I said.REVOLUTION She paused and looked at me as she digested my statement. Ahh she pretended to marvel nice. Striking below the belt again are we Of course not said I asked for the bill which came with a twenty per cent staff discount. We came to the lobby. Do you have to leave soon I said. Not supersoon why I havent rowed for a year said.A hoolchand my favourite Assi Ghat boatman recognised me from a distance. He looked amused to see me in a formal suit. He untied the boat for us. I helped Aarti on board and tipped him an extra hundred bucks. He slid a small paper packet in my hand. Whats this Good stuff. I have sourced it from the Aghori sadhus. You have a matchbox I understood what he had given me. Aarti did too and gave me a sly smile. I bought a few cigarettes and matchbox from the paan shop. I dipped the oars into the water and together Aarti and I floated away. Its been ages. I have missed this Raghav she said. Gopal I corrected without looking at her. What Did I say Raghav Oh sorry. I am so sorry. I didnt mean to ... Its okay I said. I rowed to the opposite bank of the river. The oars felt rough. My arms were not as strong as they used to be when I did this on a regular basis. The main ghats of Varanasi are packed end to end with temples and ancient structures. The soft sandy shore on the other side of the river looked desolate. A small tea kiosk was the lone hub it served the occasional tourists who went there on a boat. I anchored the boat to a tree stump. The evening sun turned the Varanasi skyline orange. Lets take a walk said Aarti raising her face to feel the breeze. We viewed the buzzing ghats on the opposite side. We could see the frantic activity but not hear a thing. We strolled for a while then went to the kiosk and sat on stools to order tea.REVOLUTION Are you going to smoke what Phoolchand gave you If you dont mind I said. She shrugged. I opened the pack of cigarettes. I teased the tobacco out of one of them and pushed the dried marijuana in. I lit it and took a puff. May I try she said. I shook my head. Her phone rang. She took it out from her bag. The screen flashed Raghav calling Shh Quiet she signalled to me. Hi she said into the phone. She listened as Raghav spoke for a while. Thats great. Yes put the panditjis picture in the paper. He will be so happy. He will give you all the marriage listings she said and grinned. Yes she continued still at the hotel. This is a terrible industry they make you work on an offday ... Yes a whole bus of French tourists has arrived She mimed at me to be patient. I nodded as I watched the sky turn dark. Yes baby I miss you Aarti signed off. She reached for the joint. What I said. Give me a puff Are you crazy Why Just because I am a girl True colours of a Varanasi man eh You will reek of it Til go straight to the shower. And what are all the Banarasi paans for Ill have a fragrant one before I go she said. I passed her the joint. She took a few puffs. It doesnt seem to have any effect on me she grumbled. Wefinishedour tea and stood up. She walked close to the water. Come lets see the aarti lamps in the water she said. Its late I said. Wed better go I like it here. Come she said and sat on the sand. She patted the ground next to her. I sat down beside her. Your phone will ring again I said. C R E T A N BHAKATWhatever she said. When he worked at Dainik he never called. Now it is a break so he does. Wait until his Revolution starts Is he serious about it I said disbelievingly. Oh yeah. Thefirstissue comes out in two weeks she said. Ifinishedmy joint and contemplated the holy river. The world came to wash away their sins in Varanasi. Did they ever stop to think about Varanasi for a moment about what its people would do with all the sins they left behind The grass had turned me philosophical. I flexed myfingerspreparing myself for the tough ride back. Aarti took my right hand into her lap and started to massage it. I looked at her in surprise. Nice she said. I didnt say anything. Not a thing. I didnt withdraw my hand either. A full moon emerged in the sky. Its purnimal she said softly. The sand beneath us her face and the moonlight.... Suddenly she began to blink furiously. You okay I asked. She shook her head still blinking. A particle of sand had blown into her eye. I withdrew my hand from her grasp and cupped her face. Open your eyes said. She shook her head again. Open Aarti said. I cradled her head with both hands. She opened her right eye. I blew into it. You okay I said. She nodded her eyes shut again. I heard her sniff. Are you hurt I said. She began to sob. She rested her forehead on my shoulder. Whats wrong Aarti Im scared for Raghav. I hope he doesnt fail in life. I held the back of her head. She buried her face in my chest. It felt strange to console her about her boyfriend. However I liked the feel of her against me. He be fine. I hate him but Raghav is capable. Hell befine.He is a little impractical but not bad at heart said.REVOLUTION She lifted her head her face turned up to me trustingly. I stroked her hair. T miss how you cared for me she said. Our faces were only a breath apart. The proximity stunned me. I couldnt speak. T have no one to talk to when I am low. Thank you she said. Droplets from the Ganga splattered on us. I felt compelled to move my face forward. My lips met hers. She didnt kiss me back. She didnt move away either. But soon too soon she pushed me away. Gopal she said. I didnt say anything. I kind of expected it. In fact I wanted her to yell at me more. Im sorry I said. I looked away. In the distance I saw the aarti diyas wobble on the water as if admonishing me. Lets go. I am late she said. She was up in a split second and was taking rapid strides towards the boat. I paid the teashop owner and ran to catch up with her. T have to row you back. You cant run away I said. She kept silent. She refused to even look at me. Okay I admit I had done wrong but she didnt have to treat me like this. A few moments ago she had massaged my hands and buried her face in my chest. She sat as far as possible from me in the boat. I slapped the oars hard on the water as I rowed back. T said sorry already I said midway. Can we not talk please she said. The boatman noticed our sour moods. Didnt like the maalV Phoolchand asked. I didnt respond. Aarti walked on. Where are you going I will drop you home I said. Til take an auto she said and disappeared from my sight.Even Babas death hadnt left me so sleepless. But Aartisflightfrom Assi had me staring at the office walls at a.m. two nights after the boat ride. I was too nervous to call or message her though I could think of nothing but her. Her face her drenched eyes and her lips on mine ... I couldnt focus on the contractors plans for my upcoming bungalows bathrooms. I sat through faculty meetings like a zombie staring at my phone nonstop. Expecting a call sir Dean Shrivastava said. I shook my head only to check my phone again. How can god give girls so much power How can they turn productive busy and ambitious men into a wilting mass of uselessness. Sir so you are okay with us conducting midterms next week said Anmol the civil engineering professor. Yes I managed to respond while wondering what fd do if she didnt call ever. On my third sleepless night my phone beeped at two in the morning. A message from her Dont call or message me. What made her send this message I hadnt called or messaged. I was sitting there holding the phone when my phone beeped again. Ever said her next message. She isnt sleeping and she is thinking of me my optimistic irrational brain kicked into action. Why did she send these messages What do they mean in Girlese Since Girlese often means saying the opposite of what is meant did this mean call me Okay I replied. I waited for an hour but got no response.REVOLUTION Soon I drifted off into a dream about boat rides. A fluorescent pink Asized sheet fell out of the morning paper. I thought it was a flyer for a travel agency or tuition classes. However it had a masthead like a newspaper. Aha I smirked Raghavs attempt to change the world. Revolution it said in big bold font. Below was a letter from the editor headlined Because Enough is Enough. I read on. What do you say about a society whose top leaders are the biggest crooks What do you do in a system where almost anyone with power is corrupt India has suffered enough. From childhood we are told India is a poor country. Why There are countries in this world where an average person makes more thanfiftytimes that an average Indian makes. Fifty times Are their people really fifty times more capable than us Does an Indian farmer not work hard Does an Indian student not study Do we not want to do well Why why are we then doomed to be poor I laughed at Raghavs selfindulgent trip. I sipped my morning tea and continued to read. This has to stop. We have to clean the system. Che Guevara the great revolutionary once said Power is not an apple that falls from a tree into your lap. Power has to be snatched from people who already have it. We have to start a revolution a revolution that resets our corrupt system. A system that shifts power back into the hands of the people and treats politicians like workers not kings. Of course this wont happen overnight. This also wont happen until the real suffering begins. As Indias young population increases we will need more good colleges and jobs. Soon there wont be enough. People will realise who is fooling them. It could take ten years. I call it Revolution the year in which it will C R E T A N BHAKAThappen the movement that will finally shake the muck off India. When the Internet will connect all colleges across the country When we will go on strike shut down everything until things are fixed. When young people will leave their classes and offices and come on to the streets. When Indians will get justice and the guilty will be punished. And it will all begin in Varanasi. For that reason we bring youRevolution .Yours truly Raghav Kashyap Editor I smiled as I saw a crudely sketched map of India under the article. It had a dot on Varanasi with arrows connecting it to various cities. The map had a little Revolution potential plan attached to it. In various cities it listed the main colleges that would lead the revolution there. My accountant came into my office for my signatures on the monthend accounts. My amused expression puzzled him. What happened sir Reading jokes he said. I nodded. The front page also carried an expose on cremation shops in Varanasi selling ordinary wood as sandalwood after spraying it with synthetic perfume. My accountant saw the pinkcoloured paper. Ts this an ad A poster he said. T have no idea I said. I turned over the Revolution page and couldnt help but laugh. In contrast to the bombast in the front the back page had matrimonial ads I read one out aloud. Wanted beautifuleducatedfairhomely virgin for twentyfiveyear Kayasth Brahmin engineer working in stable government job. Girl must be willing to stay in joint family and respect traditional values. I handed Raghav s paper to my accountant. Searching for a girl sir he said.SEVQLITTION M Z N I. looked how I felt offended Sorry sir he said. Sir we have more requests for admissions he sought to change the subject. We are full I said you know that. We have as many students as we are authorised to take Sir if the AICTE can adjust I sighed Tiow many more Five ten he said Twenty at the most Take them in said. Til manage the AICTE when the time comes Yes sir he said and left the office I picked up the pink rag ripped it apart bundled up the shreds and threw them in the dustbinmEvery Friday made rounds of the classes I kept a threeday stubble to look old enough to be a director I entered a classroom where a maths class was in progress. The professor stopped lecturing when he sighted me. The entire class of forty students stood up It felt good I could go to any of the eight classrooms and the same would happen Money status and power however evil people may say these are get you respect in life. A few years back I was begging at career fairs for an admission. Today hundreds stood up to attention when I arrived. Good afternoon. Director sir the professor said. I nodded in response A boy in m illfitting shirt in the front row blinked rapidly when I addressed him. What is your name Manoj sir he said. Where are you from I said Sarnathj sir he said Parents work there I said We haw land sir. My father is a farmer I immediately softened. You dont want to be a farmer He didnt answer afraid of how he might be judged by the response understoodCHBTAN BHAGATAny problems at GangaTech t said.Nosir he said nervously.Dont feel shy tell me I said. Too much English sir he said T dont understand it well l e a r n it. The world won t let you live otherwise. Okay I said. He nodded turned to the professor. Sorry to disturb you I said The professor smiled. He reminded me of Mr Pulley in Kota.A dozen documents awaited my attention when I returned from rayrounds. My phone beeped. Aarti had sent a message Sow RGG Yes I texted back.What do you think she wanted to know I didnt respond. I started going through the documents. My phonebeeped again. She had texted Good luck for the revolution I said. Thanks came her replyI wondered if that meant the end of conversation.You ore welcome said anyway Good to know she said Who I said. That I am still welcome. she said.I didnt know what to say to that Girls can come up with the simplestof messages that have the most complex meanings.I typed out another message I am sorry about that evening was pondering whether to send it when my phone beeped again. Sorry about that evening her message said. I gasped at the coincidence deleted what I had composed and typedagain. Its fine i shouldnt hove crossed the line. I had a reply within seconds Dont worry oho lit it Perplexed I kept my phone awayREVOLUTION What exactly did she mean Why cant girls be direct Dent worry about it Is she just being formal Or did she mean it is okay I kissed her and thai I need not worry about it ever again Most important had we dosed the chapter or opened a new oneI wanted to ask her all these questions but did not have the guts I didnt want to keep things hanging either. One kiss and her silence thereafter had devastated me I didnt want to kiss her just once. T wanted to kiss her a million times or however many times it was possible for a person to kiss another person in a lifetime. I did not want to talk to her in cryptic messages. I wanted to have her by my side all the time I didnt give a fuck about Raghav anymore He had anyway become borderline cuckoo with his pink newspaper. Aarti deserved better and who could be better than me Our college would make a crore this year. Raghav would never see a crore of his own in his entire fuckedup honest revolutionary life. These intense thoughts darted about m my head like little birds let loose from their cage. Enough is enough I spoke out loud and forced myself to pick up the phone LOVE YOU typed and kept my thumb on the send button. But I deleted the text. I replaced it with a softer MISS YOU but erased that as well I went back to my files but found it hard to read even one sentence. I closed my eyes. Immediately I remembered the warmth of her body when had held her the locks of her hair that brushed against my face in the breeze and relived the moment when had kissed her. My phone rang. She had called me. A part of me didnt want to but I picked it up in one ring. Hi she said. Aarti Yeah she said. crossed the line that day said Dont keep saying that I s it okay really I said. Really How did you like the paper Be honestL CHSTAN BHAGATI was shocked at how effortlessly she switched the topic. Kayasth Brahmin grooms on one page megarevolution on the other. Isnt if strange told you. That s how the paper becomes viable she said. What do the readers feel about that I said. Hie response is mindblowing. Raghavs exboss from Dainik had c ... called to congratulate him she stammered in her excitement Well what do I know about newspapers If people from Dainik like It it is probably good I said flatly You have seen nothing yet. Raghav is working on some big stories Great said my tone bland. Sorry I didnt mean to talk only about him Just thrilled about the first issue. I put a few copies in the hotel lobby too she confessed with a T am sure the tourists will love to see how fuckedup our country is said. Or they may like the matrimomals Aarti pointed out That evening by the river seemed to be a distant memory for hen How can girls pretendthat nothing happened Do they erase stuff from their brains brush it aside or are they just good actorsAarti I said What What if I said and paused. What if I what she said. She had put it out there. I could either chicken out and say lame crap like What if I said yon are amazing like I had over the years. Or I could be a man and say what I really wanted to even if it meant she may never talk to me again. For once I chose the latter option. What would yon do if I kissed you again Gopal she said her voice hushed. Dorft sound so surprised We did kiss remember do.nl know what happened she said. How could she not know what had occurred Dont avoid the question I said.REVOLUTION What Aarti said a rare hesitation in her voice lliat wodd yoa.doif l kissed you again I repeated dorft know she said. She hadnt said yes. However she hadnt hung up the phone in disgust eifchE might said.Dontf just might Can we talk about something else she said Are we meeting said Where she said. Again no yes or no. She didnt even say when. She simply asked the location. It meant she wanted to meet me. Even after I had warned her that wanted to kiss her she wanted to meet me A dozen smikys filled up my head. Til pick you up at work. What time do you get done Six. Mot today though. Raghav has some friends over. First issue and allPartyKind of. A lowkey affair. Raghav doesnt have money to partyEverything has gone into the paper.fYouwant me to give some money I said enjoying every syllable ofmy sentence. Stop it Gopal So tomorrow at six I will call you I saidsOh okayWhere are we going she saidSomewhere privateI said. She paused for a second Where we can talk added Let me know thenI on are in Mr Mishra I had booked a room at Ramada for five thousand a night. Any help with your luggage sir the lady at the reception asked me. I only have this I said pointing to my rucksack The receptionist smiled at me. She walked with me to the centre of the lobby and to the guest relations deskrfhisis Aarti the receptionist said and she will guide you to yourroom Aarti looked up from her computer. Her jaw dropped. Hello I said as nonchalantly as possible. Oh h i . . . I mean good evening she said flustered. Aarti this is Mr Gopal Mishra director ofGangaTech. He Is in . Please escort him to his room Sure sure Aarti said still in shock She stood up. We walked towards the elevator. A housekeeping staff member entered the elevator with us. We couldht talk She only spoke in the second floor corridor Gopal what are you doing here she whispered. She continued to walk two steps ahead of me. I had my story ready. I couldnt tell Aarti had booked a room just jiflfe We had a senior guest faculty coming from London SoHecancelled last minute. We had already paid tor the room. So thought why not enjoy the hospitality of Ramada What You should have told me I could have got you a refund.REVOLUTION Forget it I have never stayed in a livestar hotel before. Ill try it out We reached . She opened the room with the magnetic key card She looked beautiful in her uniform a formal sari with her hair every strand of it locked in a bun I dumped my rucksack on the bed Tou need help with the features of the room she said No grinned Someone already showed me You are amy Gopal she said. Anyway b e t e go I sat on the singleseater sofa in the room Stay I said. cant I am on duty After six Its livethirty already I said. cant be in a guests room You know this guest I said Two minutes She went to the door and closed it as much as possible without locking it. She sat a chair by the desk and stared at me WhatV I said. You didnt plan this she said What plan The faculty cancelled I said. Whats the name of the faculty she said. Mr Allen I said Oh really Which college Hes from I said and hesitated See. Stop fibbing she said How will know the college The dean would know All I know is we had a room and I took it She shook her head Lets hang out here after you finish I said How she said. I t s not allowed You only do things you are allowed to said.Moshe said but J You dont have the guts I said.Thats not the case she said and stood up And you know it C R E T A N BHAKATNobody will find out I said. Finish work and come We mill eat here. Leave in an hour or so Tf room service sees me she said You hide in the toilet when they come I said. Thats weird she said Okay will order before you arrive. Sandwiches She bit her lower lip and mused over my suggestion for a few seconds. Fine she sighed. But you have to check no staff is around when I come or leave Sure I will stand in the corridor. Will give you the green signal on the phone She walked to me and whacked me lightly on the side of my head. The things you make me do she said and left the roomI ordered a club sandwich chocolate cake and a bottle of wine I also took a shower using more shampoo and hot water than I normally do in a week She called me at p.m. Check the corridor I came out of the room. I t s line I said into the phone turning my head left and right to scan the corridor Two minutes later we were both in the room with the door firmly locked. She had already changed into a white button down shirt and jeans downstairs after her shift. You are stupid you know that right she said plonking herself on the bed and holding a hand dramatically to her chest. My heart is beating liilillP Relax I said. She laughed You are lucky they havent installed corridor CCTVs yet. Cant pull this stunt after that So right timing I said Hungry I opened the silver cover on the sandwich plate. Starving she admitted. added some french fries and salad to the sandwich. Come lets eatREVOLUTION I am too exhausted to move. I stood in heels for eight hours. Can I eat the bed Sure I said I passed her the plate I poured a glass of red wine. Yon ordered a foil bottle of wine she said I shrugged. When did you start drinking wine ahe said Shuklaji made me try everything I said Ton like wine usually have whisky. But I thought you might like wine. cido. But I shouldnt drink This is my place of workOne glass I insisted. She gave a brief nod and look the glass Raghav doesnt drink much. He is such a bore sometimes she said and took a sip Nice What is it Jacobs Creek from Australia I said emphasising the country of origin. It had cost me two thousand bocks but I didnt mention the prim. I t s good ft will hit me soon Relax my driver will drop you home I said. She held her sandwich tight with both hands and ate like a famine victim Slow down said. She said with food hi her mouth T havent had anything since breakfat Even in school yon used to stuff your face I teased.

One day he will Aarti vowed nd why are you talking like my relatives She picked up the remote and switched on the television. This is so boring she said and flicked through the news channels. She stopped at Channel V where an item girl danced to a remixed video She has totally done her lips she mid and a nose job and possiblya boob fobWhat saiet shocked at her choice of words Boob job. To fix your boobs make them bigger she said I looked shocked as felt. Tou are my best friend sfie said md playfully punched my arm. I can totally be myself with you She flipped channels again and suddenly we were watching When Hmry Met Sally from somewhere in the middle. Men and women cant be friends Billy Crystal said to Meg Ryan a toothpick in his mouth. Of course they can be. Look at us Aarti said impatiently and increased the volume. I low this movie Ton have seen Iff I said.REVOLUTION Yeah have you I shook my head. I didnt watch English movies. Come lets watch. Hi tell you what happened so far I moved closer to her. dimmed the room lights f r o m the bedside panel while she summarised the plot for me. Harry and Sally went about their lives meeting and fighting several times but never really connecting even though it seemed obvious that they should. We watched the movie in silence. Wow we finished the bottle she observed after a while. She lifted a pillow placed it in my lap and rested her head there for the rest of the film. You comfortable she asked looking up at me from m y lap her eyes twinkling in the TV light. I hesitated a little then placed my hand lightly on her head and gently stroked her hair. She didnt object. It felt wonderful to be with her. I couldnt think of a happier moment than this in my life s o far. Aarti I said. Yeah she said her eyes still on the TV. Is it okay for you to lie in my lap like this She nodded her eyes on the screen. Why did you run away from the river that day I said. dont want to talk about it. Watch the movie no she said. Will you run away again I said my voice heavy. She sensed the tension in me. She muted the television and sat up. You okay Gopi she said the words slightly slurred. The TV light flickered over our faces. Run now if you want to I said my voice barely making it out of my throat. Because if you stay for a while in my life and then go.. I had spoken too much. The Australian wine had managed to open up an Indian heart. Shut up she said and placed her palm on my mouth again Drama queen. Sorry drama king But I meant it I couldnt bear to be away from her. I am lonely too Gopal she said so lonely Why CRETANBHAKATRaghav has no time. My parents cant see why I want to work. They cant understand why the DMs daughter has to slog. All my girlfriends are getting married planning kids and I am not. I am weird. You are different I corrected her. Why am I different Why cant I just be normal satisfied to be at home waiting for my husband Thats not normal. Thats backward. Raghav stresses me out. I want to support him. But he cant seem to get his act together. He rejected a tieup with a newspaper for the sake of independence. How is he ever going to make money like this I thought you said he will one day I said. I put on a brave face. But I can discuss my fears with you no she said. Of course you can I said and caressed her cheek. We turned to the T V screen. One night Sally was feeling low. Harry comes over to her house. He comforts her. They end up kissing. I dont know if the scene motivated me or the wine or the fact that I felt I might not get another chance. I leaned over to kiss Aarti. She looked up at me in surprise. However she did not protest. Just stared. I kissed her again this time more insistently Nothing for two minutes and then she was kissing me back. We kissed again and again. I kissed her lips her cheeks her forehead her nose her ears and her lips again. I switched off the lights. When I hugged her again she said This is wrong. knowM said but I cant stop. My hand reached for her shirt buttons. No she said and gripped that hand hard. I slid my other hand under her shirt. Thank god men have two hands nobody could make out otherwise. My palm was at last on her breast. Gopal you realise what is happening she said. I shook my head. We shouldnt... she said. I shut her up with another kiss. She wriggled a little but I kept kissing her. She started to respond. Slow at first then matching and finally outpacing me.REVOLUTION This isnt right Gopal she panted biting my lower lip. I answered in kisses. The movie had ended. heard shampoo commercials in the background as I tugged at her top to take it off Dont Gopal she whispered but raised her arms to make my job I removed my shirt This time hen we embraced her warmth and softness melted into me care for you so much Stop talking she I said. interrupting garbled speech.I gently pushed a her slouldersto make her lie back the bed.

You are an amazing girl I said my finger dipping into her navel I parsed to kiss her there The most amazing girl in the world I placed her hand on my body I went back to undoing her jeans. Girls wear the most unremovable tight jeans in the world I found it impossible to take them off without her help Could you I said after a fiveminute struggle My request brought forth a giggle. She wriggled to take them olF. I waited and then drew her close to me. Gopal she said and held me close Passion repressed for years came forth unleashed I bit her and kissed her all the time that I was becoming one with her. I knew my life would no longer be the same again What happened only magnified my love for her They say men withdraw after sex. But I wanted to draw her close cuddle and keep her with me forever. Spooning C R E T A N BHAKATher tightly kissed her hair as she looked ahead with no particular iiiiiiMtiYou are wonderful Aarti Every bit of you is wonderfulShe halfsmiled. I raised myself on an elbow Did you like it I said. She nodded but looked elsewhere. Took at me I said. She did turn her eyes to me but looked past m e Are you okay I said. She nodded. We lay down again. A little red LED beeped on the ceiling. What s thatr said worried it could be a camera.Smoke alarm she said. We remained silent for a few minutes. cant live without you Aarti I said. Dont say that please she said. Its true. love you I said. Please stop she said and sat up on the bed covering herself with the bedsheet Whats the matter I said holding her arm through the sheet. Her phone beeped. She looked at the message She let out a deep breath as she punched a reply Can I wear my clothes She slid away from meHuhV I said. SureShe draped the bedsheet around her picked up her clothes and went to the bathroom I switched on the lights. A confused mix of emotionsstewed in mc.She obviously cares for mefor no girl will do what she did otherwise. Yet why was she acting distant Does she expect me to tell her I will be there for her now Or is she regretting it Is this going to bring us closer or take us further apartI was naked and confused I couldnt resolve my confusion but I could at least wear my clothes. She reentered the room while I was buttoning my shirt. better go home she said decisivelyREVOLUTION The bedside dock said a. m. Dont von have to stay till a.m. I asked. Til. say the shift ended earlier. In either case they would be too sleepy to check the time now she said. Sit with me wanted to say I wanted to talk I wanted her to know how much this meant to me Isnt this what girls wantt anyway to talk. Will you call your driver she said Stay for live minutes I begged. Please She moved to the sofa I sat on the bed. Why are you m teo.se I said me You still need proof she asked I came next to her. I held her hand It felt cold dont want you to feel ashamed about it I said This is special We have to be proud of it But am in a relationship she said. With a guy who is never there for you I said. She turned to me in surprise. I havent ever commented about you and Raghav That doesnt mean I dont notice Aarti you deserve better Yon deserve all the joys of life I am a simple girl Gopal Aarti said biting her lip. Even a simple girl needs love security attention support. Right said She kept quiet The simple girl will get married someday She will need to know if her husband will be able to raise a family with her said. I had remained defensive for years. With Aarti by my side felt confident to go the offensive am tired I want to go home she said and stood up I called my driver I offered to come down with her. She declined. She came close to me before she left expected a kiss but there was only a brief hug The door shut behind her Her scent lingered in the room for hours and in my heart for days. am your Gopal Dont you care forIIe didnt talk to each other for two days after the Ramada night. I couldnt control myself any longer and finally called her. She couldnt speak to me as her parents were around her However she agreed to meet me at CCD the next morning before work am sorry I freaked out she said taking little sips from her extrahot black coffee. She wore a crinkly purple skirt and a white printed top. Her wet hair told me she had just taken a shower have twenty minutes before I leave for work she said What happened to you that night I said. Well you know what happened she said. You have to come to me Aarti I said I placed my hand on hers. GopalIs she said and pulled her hand away What I said. wanted her to look at me with shy eyes smile at our shared experience and squeeze my hand tight None of it happened. People know us she said instead. Steam from our coffee cups rose between us The cafe felt warm compared to the chilly December morning outside. To you love me I said desperate for her confirmation. She had tolove me. How could she notAarti let out a breath of frustration. What is the matter with you At least accept your feelings now said. Do vou want to know what I feel she said.More than anything eke I said.Guilt she saidWhy I said almost in protest Wasnt it wonderful Isnt this loveREVOLUTION Gopal you have to stop using the word love okay she said. Girls cannot be understood. Period. I became quiet. Raghav did me no wrong she spoke after a minute staring outside the window. S o this is about Raghav . . I said as she cut me. Can you listen Simply listen okay she said her gage stern. I had to comply Men are bom on earth to listen to girls. So I nodded. He only wanted to make a living white doing the right thing. Its not eashesaidv nodded again hoping like hell I didrft come across as fake. I shouldnt have cheated on him. I am a terrible person I nodded again. You think I am a terrible person she said I kept quiet. Say something she shouted. You told me to listen I said So do that she said WhatrisaiA Say something she said. Theres something about malefemale conversation I don t think one side ever gets what the other side intends. Aarti you are a sensible girl You dont do stuff unless you want to What are you trying to say she said. You never said yes to me despite my attempts for years. Something made you do it .that night I made a mistake she said I must admit her saying this felt like crap. The most special day of my life classified as a mistake for hen I controlled my anger. Was it Why did you come to meet me today I said. I t s just coffee she said her eyes shifty Aarti dont lie. Mot to me. If your feelings have changed theres nothing to be ashamed of I said Tears rolled down her cheeks I picked up a tissue and leaned forward towipe them. She looked around and composed herself. C R E T A N BHAKATGopal in every relationship there is a weaker person and there is a stronger person. The weaker person is the one who needs the other person more True I said Its not easy being the weaker one in the relationship. Mot all the time she said I know the feeling I said She looked at me. am sorry. I am listening i said. My parents are pressurising me to get married. I cant fight them forever she said. Raghav doesnt seem to understand that He doesnt want to marry you I said Only in a couple of years. He avoids the topic. Sometimes it is about not being settled sometimes about work being too dangerous mostly he is too busy. What about me I nodded. Sometimes your best chance with women lies in adequate nods I made mine just right with a measured swinging of the headcHeloves me I know. Every now and then he sends a sweet SMS. Itsnice I realised she was thinking aloud. I pretended to listen but focused on her triangular purple earrings that bounced mildly when she spoke She finished her pros and cons after five minutes Thanks for listening she said. Why me I said. What do you mean she said. Whydid you deep with me Sure you had some problems withRaghav But why me She looked at me. She had softened a little alter venting out Because I like you she said You do I said Of course I do. And I know what I mean to you I swear I would be so happy if you found another girl I cant I saidREVOLUTION Caht what cant be with another girl Its you or nobody I said looking her straight in the eye. You realise how guilty that makes me feel she said So yon fed guilty if you sleep with me and if yon dont She gave a wry smile. Its not easy being a girl We feel guilty about everything Dont be confused Come to me I said What about Raghav she said. He needs me at this stage He does what he wants to. Why shouldnt you That work. He never stops me from work infidelity is different Ton inspire me Aarti I said cant fell yon how much I want to do in life if you are by my side. I want to expand my college. We can open an aviation academy MBA maybe medicine You dont need me for that she said. want you for myself. Without you there is no me I said. People break up all the time Aarti Yon guys are not married We will be so happy And Raghav she said. H e will be fine. Hell find someone a journalist or activist or something said. She laughed.

Not at all I said She checked the time. She had to leave I called my driver who slowly rolled up in a black Mercedes Wow she raid I s that yours CHETAN BHAGATNo it belongs to the trust. It is for Shuklaji. We just took delivery We got into the car. t h e black leather felt warm Its got seat heaters f said showing her the controls One day Mr Gopal you will have your own she said as we reached the hotel Car or girl winked at her Both hopefully she said and winked back When can we meet said aloneGopalWe dont have to do anything. In fact I don t want to do anything Famous last words from every guy she said and walked into the Guards saluted the black Mercedes as it drove out of the hotel gate.She drew the curtains in her room. Hospital Its dads knees againAarti and I continued to meet though seldom in public places.Mostly she would call me home when her parents were out Even withhalf a doxen servants in the house her room had privacy. Two months had passed since the night at Ramada. Her guilt for cheating on Raghav had subsided somewhat or at least she hid it well from me. I stopped asking her if she loved me as it only moved her away from me. Girls are contradictory. They will say they like communication but on certain topics they clam up. If they like you they would prefer you sense it rather than make them say it.Grapes she said as she offered me a tray of fruit.Feed me said as I sprawled out on her easy chair. Shut up she said and shoved the tray towards me. She sal on the chair across me. We had an unwritten rule we stayed away from her bed.Once I saidWhat is this she said and stood up. She picked up a bunch of grapes and brought it close to my mouth. As I parted my lips she pushed thewhole bunch inside.REVOLUTION Thats not bow yon feed kings I said struggling to talk as juices squirted from my mouth M you boysare the same First you chase but when you get the girl yon want to be kings she said Yonare my queen my dear I said.Cheesy Corny.

Guys always want to do things. Yet she knew I wasnt lying I had never asked her to come to my campus where we could be totally alone. Neither had I attempted another Ramadadike rendezvous Really I said my tone serious. You dent want to she said. She was wearing a saffron salwar and a white kameez I wanted her more than any woman or for that matter anything in the world Still I bad a condition Not until Raghav is out of your system I said What she said That night at Ramada I had your body not your soul dont want it to be like that again You dont get people out of your system overnight she said. know But are you trying dont know she said. No matter how much I deny it the fact is meet you almost everyday She sat on the armrest of my chair So are yen ready to call it off with him I said. As finished my sentence her phone rang. Its him she said. CHBTAN BHAGATI became quiet. Hey she said to him. She sat close enough for me to hear Raghavs voice on the other end We hit five thousand copies he was saying. Congratulations Aarti said. We will get proper brands to advertise soon. What are you doingIcame home early Aarti saidParents Moms taken dad to the hospital. His knees are killing him. Hell have to replace bath of them Thats awful he said. I played with Aartfs hair as she spoke to Raghav. She made a face at me to make me stop I didrft.

She grabbed my hand as she spoke. could meet you for a midnight coffee Raghav said. Have to be with dad And every time i go out late mom wants to get me married the next week You are so young Raghav said. My family doesnt get all that Cousins my age are married she said Can we not start a fight again Raghav said. Tm exhausted TIB not Aarti said T love you bye Raghav said smartly. Do you Aarti said. Aarti craon I have to hang up. I do love you. Say it no Raghav said Xove you. Bye she said I withdrew my hand from her face. What she said. This is what I mean by getting him out of your system said. Tt was just a simple chat she said. You said love. With me you dont like that wordREVOLUTION wanted to be normal Thats how we end calls she said. She walked up to the window and stared outside T m sorry its not easy hearing you say that to another man I said. I f s not easy being a cheat she said and turned ail tearyeyed. I took her in my arms. At some point he will find out Aarti said her face buried in my chest. I just want to tell him myself Will you be with me I said. She gae a barely perceptible nod without lifting her face T will love yon forever Aarti I said. She hugged me tight After a while she looked at me Should I tell him she said.

Myfirstguest I had planned Would be the person who made this possible Shuklaji. I had amted hijfi fop f inch. I hurried the hostel chef The gas stove at my new poflpe Iid woidk and the chef wanted to go to the hostel kitchen to ihidishesREVOLUTION Bring the stove here I shouted. eMLA sir is coming I cant trust the hostel cooking Of course I also wanted Aarti to be one of my i t s guests. However I had promised myself that Aarti would come to my new house as my girlfriend not someone elses girlfriend having a parallel affair with me. She SMSed me Hows the move gng When do i c the place I replied U can come anytime but i wont let u leave. Let me meet Raghav first R u sure Am so nervous about u meeting him. I was composing a reply to her when my phone rang I picked up Shuklajfs call Sir we are making pnris. Come hungry okay I said Come home Gopal he said am home. My new home I mean this is also your home Tm screwed Shuklaji said his voice unusually tense. What Come to my place. Your fucker friend I wont spare him. Come right nowWhathappened We have lunch . l was saying but he cut the call Hie chef arrived panting at my house carrying the heavy stove on his shoulders. I t willtake only an hour he said reassuringly to me. l u n c h has been cancelled I said and walked out of the house. My phone beeped Another SMS from Aarti U should let me decorate the house. A f e r oil hotel industry all sent her a smiley and kept the phone back in my pocket. MLA Shuklas place I told the driver.MLA Shuklas men stood in a circle in Shuklajis verandah. They looked mournful as if someone had just died. Pinkcoloured papers lay strewn on the coffee table. Wheres Shukla sir said C R E T A N BHAKATOne of Ms party workers pointed to his office Wait here. He is on an important call he said What happened I said The party worker did not respond. He looked pointedly at the pink papers I picked one up. Revolution said the masthead as pompous as ever A miniature map of India showing the socalled command centres of the revolution was the logo MLA m a t e money hy making holy river filthy said the headline.A poor quality black and white picture of Shuklaji occupied a quarter ofthe pagef crores sanctioned tbrDirnnapura Sewage Treatment Plant. MLA pockets f crore said the subheadline. These are all old done to death bullshit allegations right I said. Raghav liked to stir things up but surely nobody would give a fuck about his rag. No one in the room responded to me. Half the party workers couldnt read the paper anyway. The others seemed too scared to talk.I read on.Early Monday morning in Navabaga a group of childrenwalk towards their school waistdeep in sewage water. It isa gutwrenching sight to see filthy water everywhere. Stink pervades the air People of the neighbourhood dont know what happened They do know that this hadnt happened before the government implemented the Ganga Action Plan GAP Yes the same plan meant to clean up our holy river has ended up spreading more filth around our city. How Weil because none of the projects meant to clean up the river were implemented. The Navabaga flooding apart the river isfilthierthan ever To give you an idea the presence of fecal coliform a form ofbacteria should not be more than unitslitre. At the ghats the fecal coliform levels are unitslitre. Not only is our river dirty we are living with serioushealth hazards.REVOLUTION I saw Shuklaji come out of his office I rushed to him. He signalled me to wait and I saw that he was still on the phone. He picked up a few files and returned to the office. I continued to read Revolution found many truths about the GAP scam. However the most shocking one is about MLA Raman Lai Shuklas Dimnapura Sewage Treatment Plant in Varanasi. Built at a cost of crores the plant remained dysfunctional for years. When finally made operational it never cleaned the water. We have startling facts with proof on what happened inside the plant Hie opposition has done this one party worker said to another I sat down to.finish the article. When untreated water reached the plant eighty per cent of it was diverted downstream into the Varuna river and dumped right back without any cleaning. The remaining twenty per cent of water was released at Dimnapura plants own exit untreated When the inspectors took the input and output measurements at points before and after the plant it showed an eighty per cent drop in pollutants. Meanwhile the water dumped into the Varuna river met the Ganga a few kilometres later. Hie net effect no treatment of water at all and the river remaining as polluted as ever. Shukla took credit for the plant showing an eighty per cent drop in pollutants. The construction company AlliedCon is owned by the MLAs uncle Roshan Shukla who made fake invoices for pumps that were never purchased scans below We will kill this newspaper a party worker whispered m my ear as he saw me read with such concentration The bottom of the page had several images. These included fake invoices for pumps amounting to f crores. However the actual site pictures showed no such pumps Installed. A scanned letter from the pump manufacturer showed they never supplied the pumps. The ownership structure of AlliedCon confirmed links to Shuklajis family. Finally the C R E T A N BHAKATpaper had a picture of the Varuna river with a dot to show the exact point where the effluents were released The CM is coming down from Lucknow a party worker announced and worried murmurs rippled around the room. I could tell Raghav had worked hard on the story He had suffered earlier for doing a story without evidence. This time he had left nothing to chance. The fake invoices contractorMLA link and the audacity to dump the dirty water right back into the revered Ganga didnt spell good news for Shuklaji Locals would be livid A politician stealing is bad enough but to rob from the holy river is the worst sin. I f s not even a real newspaper Shukiajfs PA was discussing the matter with someone. Couple of thousand copies nobody will pay attention to it The low circulation of Revolution had become the MLAs only hope. Party workers had removed as many copies from the newsstands as they could. However Revolution came free like a brochure inside newspapers It would be impossible to get rid of it completely Aarti was calling. I stepped out to the lawns. Saw R today she said I didnt know the paper had an acronym T have it in my hand said She breathed audibly before she spoke again Ts it too much she said I sneered I t s Raghav. When is he not too much I t is shocking isnt it They dump the dirty water elsewhere in the river and claim to have cleaned it He is taking on big people. He should be careful But he is only speaking the truth. Someone has to stand up for the just said he needs to be careful I said dont want him to be in trouble she said scared He desnt like to stay out of it I replied. Ts he in trouble she said pausing after every word.REVOLUTION l i o w would know said I heard the noise of traffic outside the houses Crnon Gopal you and MLA Shukla J she said and paused Tm not Involved in any scam okay I screamed Horns blared outside as I walked towards the gate. I didnt say that she said softly just dent want Raghav to be in dangu I may not be faithful to Mn but I dont want him to get hurt Hold on for a second Aarti I said I came to the gate. My eyes popped as I saw the scene. Six vans from different T Y channels had parked themselves outside the house. The guards were struggling to keep the reporters out as they stood there airing live with the MLAs house as backdrop Whats going on I asked the guard They want to come in the guard said They know the CM is coming. Everything okay Aarti asked anxiously on the phone. Yeah so far Promise me Raghav won t get hurt Its not in my hands Aarti I said exasperated. T dont even know what will happen. Its a small paper Maybe the story will die I t won t she said What All the mainstream newspapers and channels are in Revolution office she said. Puck said as a fleet of white Ambassador cars approached the house. Photographers went berserk as they took pictures of everyone around including me Will Raghav be okay Promise me Aarti have to go I jogged back to the house. sJDveryone stood in attention as the CM entered the house. The aura of power could be sensed along every inch of the MLAs bungalow Shuklaji came running and greeted the CM with folded hands. Who called the media the CM said his voice purposeful What Shuklaji said as clueless as anyone else in the room. Lets go inside the CM said. The two leaders disappeared into MLA ShuMas office The CMs minions mixed with the MLAs minions in the hall Even the minions maintained a hierarchy The CMs minions stood with their heads held high while the MLAs minions looked at the floor. I didnt lit in anywhere. I sat on a wooden chair in the corner of the room Gopal Shiildafis booming voice startled me. looked up. He asked me to come into his office. Once in the MLA shut the door Gopal sir. He runs my college my trusted man. Bright and J You know the person who did it the CM asked me with no interest in my qualities or capabilities. Raghav Kashyap sir. Friend once not anymore You couldnt shut him up the CM said.eWehad him fired from Dainik. He started his own rag after that Isaid Nobody cares about it The media has sniffed it out. The rag doesnt matter much but if he gives interviews or provides all the evidence to the media it is going toSifalEHe Is already doing that I said.Both of them looked at me with accusing eyes.R E V O L U T I O N ZQIOMy sources told me. I am not in touch with him I clarified We carft handle him the CM asked. How can you open a college without handling people I understood what he meant by hand I ing He caiit be bought sir I said For a second felt proud o f Raghav. It felt like a good thing to be someone who can t be bought. What do you mean by cunt bet Everyone has a price the CM said He doesnt I said. have known him for years Hes mad Weli he does want to live doesnt he Shuklaji said I noticed his eyes were red I looked at the CM He shook his head Slmkhji is not in the right frame of mm he said. No CM sir I will n o t S h u k l a j i began Calm down Shuklaji the CM said h is voice loud Do you have any Idea what has happened Hie MLA looked down You didnt even make a plant Ten p e r cent here and there doesnt matter But what were yon thinking shoving the dirty water into Varum This is Mother Ganga People will kill ml the CM said I offered to leave the room but the C M told me to sit right there. We have elections next year. Raman have always respected your space and never interfered But this will take us down will fix it CM sir Shukla said will I promise you How By killing the Journalist said it m mgerl Shuklaji said his tone apologetic Anger makes people do a lot of unpredictable things. It makes voters throw out governments I know when a i c a m report has teeth and when it doesnt This one does Tell me what to do sir Shuklaji said. And I will do it Resign the CM said and got up to leave What Shuklaji said his face looking bleached f s not personal Resign with grace and maybe you will come backElse the MLA said after a pause. C H ETAN BHAATDont make me fire yon Shukla. You are a friend the CM said But the party i s Mfpfi Tt happens. You will be back the CM said. He then walked out briskly with his minions. The press was waiting outside for the CM to give a statement I followed the CM s workers to the gate. came for a routine visit the CM told the reporters. What is your view on the Dimnapura Plant scam a reporter shouted hoarsely. am not fully aware of the situation. It looks like a smear campaign. Our party is clear on corruption. Even if there are allegations we ask our leaders to step down The C M jostled past the reporters and sat in his car So will MLA Shukla resign one of the reporters managed to jam the mike close to the CMs face. That is for him to decide die CM said hinting at the inevitable The CMs car left I wondered what would happen to my GangaTech went back to Shuklajfs room We will destroy the newspaper office a party worker was saying to Shuklaji Shuklaji did not respond. Tell its what to do Shuklaji. What did CM sir say another minion Leave me alone Shuklaji said. Party workers got the message. They scuttled a w y within seconds. Soon only he and I remained in his big house. Sir I said. Do you need me Shukiaji looked at me. He no longer had his trademark ramrod posture. H e slouched on the sofa elbow on the armrest and face in his pataofcThe CM is a behenchod he said. friendship Realisation slowly dawned on Shuklaji He clenched his fists inREVOLUTION When lie needed his election funding he came to me. I did his dirty work distributing liquor all over the state. Mow he screws me YOB will cpme out of it Shuklaji yon always do Nobody gives a fuck about cleaning the Ganga. Everyone made money on that plan. So why me I didnt have an answer I felt a tinge of guilt Maybe Raghav did it to Slmklii. because he wanted to get even with me. Or maybe it was my Imagination. Raghav would expose anyone be could. You run GangaTech properly okay I dorft want any rood from here to reach there he saidOf course sir said Anyway you are here sir We have big growth Hie lock me up he said calmly decades in politics making him wise enough to forecast events What I said shocked Once I resign I have no power Many MLAs have made money in the GAP scam. Before it spreads they will lock me op to show they have taken action You are the MLAS Shuklaji. The police cannot touch you said. They will If the CM asks them. I will go in for a while Fay my dues if I ever vmnt a comeback The thought of my fatherfigure and mentor going to jail unsettled me I had very few people in life I could call my own. Shukiaji counted as one of them Waif here Shufclaji said and got up. He went into his bedroom and returned with a set of keys. Keep it he said. T cant be seen with such flashy stuff picked up the keys They belonged to the black Mercedes. Your new car I can t J I placed the keys back the table Keep it for me. You are like my son I will also move some money Into the trust Make the college big Alone How cm I do that alone I said my voice choked. You havent even come to my houseCHBTANBHAGATT cant step out of here. My relatives are waiting outside with their cameras he said. Shuklaji spent the next hour explaining to me his various hank accounts and businesses. He had Ms people running them but he was telling me in case of an emergency. GangaTech is my cleanest business and can aid my comeback one day He wrote out his resignation in front of me and asked me to fax it to Lucknow. The fax machine beeped as the transmission started l i e fucked us ehfSheMafsafd Who I said Your friend. I had him fired He got me fired He tried to rain my life. I will ruin his life I vowedE v e r y newspaper of Varanasi city carried the Blmnaptira Plant scam storf on the front page the next morning. Shuklaji whose resignation became public had become the new villain in town and Raghav Kashyap the new hero. Everyone spoke highly of the stupid pink paper. Local television channels covered the scam for hours on end. flicked through the channels on my new fortyinch LCD television. paused when I saw Raghav being interviewed I t took us two months of secret work to get ail the evidence on the scam Everyone knew this MLA was shady hut there just wasnt proof. Our team did It Raghav said smugly He had lost weight and looked sleepdeprived with his unshaven face and dishevelled hair. Yet he had a glint in his eye Who is your team the reporter asked him Well we are a small newspaper called Revolution There are four of us including me. We dont have much experience but we are passionate about our work What are you passionate about Making a difference. Changing India for the better. That is what we llve for Raghav said I s it true that you believe India will have a revolution in the year m m Yes hut we all have to work towards it and make sacrifices for it What exactly will the revolution be for A society where truth justice and equality are respected more than power. Such societies progress the most Can you explain that CHETAN B H A G A tPowerdriven societies resemble animal societies. Might is right is the rule of the jungle and applies to beasts And beasts do not progress humans do I turned off the TV. I couldnt take his bullshit anymore Neither could Sliuklas men Nitesh one of the party workers called me in the morning. You smashed what I said on the phone Hisonly computer is in pieces We took hammers and broke the printing press too Nobody saw yon We went at might. Ransacked the office. Bastard. Hes finished I got ready for work I saw the Mercedes parked outside. I had a less than yard commote to the office. Yet I wanted to go in my new car. I thought about Raghav. After yesterdays bravado and all that attention a plundered office was all he was left with. He had no job no business and soon nobody would give a hick about his paper alter this story died. Where sir the driver said. Office said. I made up dialogues to say to Raghav in my head. ke averagelooking dumb Gopal Mishra the boy you had preached to saying you cm try again next year is sitting in a Mercedes. You have a broken printing press. And you think you are handsome right Well soon I will make your girlfriend mine. The girl you stole from mecSlrthe driver prompted We had reached office.I entered my office. I sank into the leather chair and closed my eyes. visualised Raghavs face when I told him Aarti is with me It would be amazing. I had planned it all I would go to his office I would drop the Mercedes keys on his table. I even had some lines ready. Sometimes losers get ahead in life. Never forget that I said out loud to practise for Dday I still didnt have the right lines to break the news about Aarti being mine. I decided to try a couple of themREVOLUTION Buddy Isorry to say this hut Aarti is mine I mumbled.That didnt sound manly enough.Aarti and I are a couple fust wanted you to know I tried a casual one. Couldnt quite pull it off. How do you come up with a suitable sentence to convey something you have meant to say for years I wanted my words to bombblast him to hit him like a letbd weapon I wanted him fa know thai he had made me feel inadequate all my life. I wanted him t burn with jealousy seeing my can my life and hurt like hellfar losing the girl he stolefrom me. I wanted to tell Mm I am better than you. asshole without actually saying it Aartfs call disrupted my thoughts They attacked his office she said her voice disturbed. Oh really I acted surprised.Revolution cm be published The press is broken she said.I scanned the files on my desk. didnt care If the stupid rag came out or not You there Aarti said MLA Shukla could be jailed I said He should isnt it He stole money and dirtied the river Are you on his side or mine I said to Aarti Irritated. What How is this about sides she said Are you with me I said. Huh she said Yes. But shouldnt we wait to tell Raghav till he settles down Will he ever settle down I said She went quiet Come home I said. Yoox place she said. You are finally showing me your new home Tomorrow I have a morning shift will he done by three Tli send my car I saidCHETAN BHAGATI kept one eye on the TV and another on the porcft as l waited tor me Mercedes to arrive with Aarti The afternoon rain had slowed down traffic and the car took longer than it should have Images of Shukiajfs arrest flickered on T V I have d o m no wrong I will foe out soon he proclaimed on one o f the channels. He had preempted his own arrest to win some public sympathy He had called me before going to jail. He seemed relaxed Perhaps he had cut a deal with the party. Or maybe he didnt realise that the party had made him the fallguy. Ifs not so bad If I pay jail is like a hotel he had told me. I saw the black car approach. My heart beating fast I rushed out.S h e stepped out of the car She had come in her work sari. Wow yon have a bungalow she said. Its mt mine its oars wanted to tell her but didnt. She hugged me but looked serious M good I said. Raghavjs expose has created complete chaos. Even my family has been affected she said. What happened I said. But what is this first come in She came in and stepped on the new silk carpet I had laid out in her honour. She saw the huge TV the velvet sofas and the eightsealer dining table. For a moment she forgot about Raghav. Tour coEege is doing this well she said wideeyed. Ibis is only the beginning I said and came forward to hold her With you by my side see where take it. University status in three years Big man Gopal You have become a big man she said I shook my head. Tor yon I am the same I said I kissed her on the forehead I offered to show her the house. We went upstairs and saw each of the three bedrooms. My room had a kingsize bed with a twelveinch mttreas Next to the bed I had kept a rocking chair similar to BbaV She kept quiet throughout my guided tour. Every time I showed her something like the marble tiles or the split airconditioner she looked suitably awed. However she seemed more interested in watching the excitement on my face than the fittings. I threw myself on the bed She sat on the rocking chair We looked at the window as rain splattered on the panes. C R E T A N BHAKATIt s raining she said excited. I t s an auspicious sign. The first time you came to our house said. She raised an eyebrow. Tt is ours not mine. I made it for us said. Shut up. You didnt know we would be together when construction startedshe said and grinned. I smiled. Correct. But I have done it up for us. Else why would I need such a big house You are the director. It s not a joke she said. You want to talk about Raghav I said. I sensed she needed to. We dont have to she said and shook her head putting on a brave smile. Come here I said and patted the bed. She hesitated but I extended my hand. She held it as I pulled her gently down. I kissed her and she kissed me back with closed eyes. It wasnt frantic or sexual. It was if at all it is possible to kiss like that chaste and pure. However we kissed for a long time our pace as gentle as the rain on the window I felt her tears on my cheeks. I paused and held her shoulders. She hugged me and buried her face in my chest. It was what Aarti always did and I loved it when she did that. It made me feel protective. Whats up my love I said to her. T am happy for you Gopal. I really am. Us. Say happy for us I said. She nodded even as she fought back tears. am happy for us. And I dont want to ruin your moment of showing me your house. Its fine I said.cYouhave worked so hard to get here. You deserve this she said.What do you want to talk about I said. She shook her head and composed herself. I waited for her to talk. T m fine. Girls are emotional. You will get used to my drama she said. T live for your drama I said.REVOLUTION She smiled. How s Raghav They ruined his office she said. Politicians are vindictive. Is he hurt I said. No thank god. The computer and the machines are all broken. He is trying to bring the issue out but theres no money He wants money He can ask me I said. I wished he would come and beg me on bended knees. You know hell never do that. He wont even take money from me. So said. Hes trying to figure stuff out Are you still with me I said. Gopal f she said. What wouldnt be sitting on your bed. I wouldnt be you know .. Okay okay said. I took a pillow and sat against the headrest. She sat on her haunches facing me. You have to stop asking me so much. Please understand this is difficult for me she said. What said. Breaking up with him especially at this time. And you want to break the news t o him That s life Aarti I said. I planned to go meet Raghav next week. One should be sensitive ... she said. Nobody was sensitive to me when I didnt clear my entrance exam two years in a row. Nobody gave a fuck when Baba died. I lived with it. Aarti he will learn to face life You men ... why are you so competitive all the time she said. Me Raghav is nothing compared to me today. Why would I compete with him We can still wait a few months . . s h e said but I cut her. I caiit bear you to be someone elses girlfriend I said my voice loud. Really she said patting my cheek. C R E T A N BHAKATNot for another second I said. I tugged at the loose end of her Ramada sari bringing her close to me. We kissed. The rain grew insistent noisy thumping the window rhythmically We kissed and naturally my hand went to her blouse. Mr Director she smiled T thought you said you didht want to have me until he was out of my system. Isnt heI said. Almostshe said closing her eyes. Well maybe this will help get the remaining bits out I said and brought her lips to mine again. I plundered her neck planting as many kisses as the raindrops on the window. We undressed with a lot more awareness than the previous time These are my work clothes please keep them carefully she said as I tried to fold the neverending sari. Our naked bodies felt toasty in the cold weather. We huddled under the quilt and explored each other for hours. The rain stopped started and stopped again. She wanted to get closer to me perhaps to justify leaving Raghav. I wanted to show her how much she meant to me. I could give up this oversized house the black car the entire college for her. This time she looked me in the eye as she surrendered herself. We dozed off. Its six o clock she said peering into her mobile phone on the sidetable. Ten more minutes I said nuzzling her shoulder. Lazy bones wake up she said. And I am famished. Such a big house and nothing to eat I sat up. Still groggy I said Theres food. The cook made so many things for you. Let s go downstairsWe had hot samosas jalebis masala cheese toast and hot chai. This isnt healthy Aarti said. We sat on the dining table facing eachother. Delicious in the rain though I said. I switched on the lights as dusk fell. She ate in silence digesting the food as well as what had just happened. I wanted to discuss the afternoon but curbed my desire to blab about everything. Girls dont like to discuss intimate moments especially if you probe them. However they also get upset if you dont refer to the moments at all. Quite wonderful I said The samosas she said even though she knew my context. No the jalebis I said. She threw a piece of the curvy yellow sweet at me. The best afternoon of my life I said after our laughter subsided. Thats what all men wantshe said. I realised I shouldnt discuss the topic any longer lest she fall into a bout of selfinflicted guiltinduced depression. Hey y o u said Raghavs expose is affecting your family I said. Well you know the CM fired Shukla right He didnt resign or go to jail himself as he said on TV The party told him to she said. know I said.She poured herself a second cup of tea. I imagined her living with me. How w e would wake up in the morning and have tea in bed. Maybe we would have it on the terrace. Or in the lawns. I visualised us sitting on cane chairs and chatting for hours. I imagined her as the principal of the GangaTech College of Hospitality. The students would totally flirt with GHETAN BHAGATher given she would be the cutest principal in history. I would expel them if they tried to ... Are you listening She tapped her cup with a spoon. Huh I said. Sorry. Yeah the party removed Shuklaji. So The party doesnt have a strong candidate for elections next year Aarti said. They willfindsomeone I said. Ifinishedmy tea and kept the empty cup on the table. She poured me some more. I almost went into a dream sequence again. I controlled myself and listened to Aarti. They need a candidate who can win. They cant lose this city. It is the partys prestige seat she said. What difference does it make to you They want dadAarti said. Oh I said. I had forgotten about Aartis grandfathers connection to the party He had won the seat for thirty years. Yeah. Now dozens of politicians visit everyday begging him Pradhanji please contest He doesnt want to Aarti shook her head. WhyI said. He doesnt like politics. Plus his health is an issue. He cant walk or stand for a long time because of his knees. How will he campaign and do those ralliesAarti said. True Thats not all Aarti said you havent heard the most ridiculous suggestion. What That contest Aarti said. She laughed hard as if she had cracked a great joke. didntfindit funny. ThatsI said something to think about Are you crazy Aarti said. Me and politics Hello I thought you know me. They clipped my wings from flight attendant to guest relations. Now they will make me visit a thousand villages and sit with seventyyearold men all dayREVOLUTION I t s power Aarti I said Means a lot in this country. don t care about power. I dont need it. I am happy Aarti said. I looked into her eyes. She seemed sincere. Are you happy with me T will be. We have to resolve some stuff but I know I will be she said more to herself than to me. She left soon after that. Her parents had visitors more party officials who also wanted to meet Aarti. I dropped her home so Id get some more time with her.c YouIIbe alone on the way back Aarti pointed out.I shrugged. Thanks for a lovely day she said as we reached her house. My pleasure I said. Have a good dinner with the politicians Oh please. Shoot me in the head she said. Both of us stepped out of the can I leaned on the bonnet as she walked towards her gate. Sure you dont want to become an MLA I said from behind. She turned to me. No way she said. Maybe my husband can if he wants t o She winked at me before skipping towards her house. I stood there surprised. Was she implying something Did she want m e to be the MLA More specifically did she want me to be her husband Aarti what did you say I said. But she had already gone into her house.I hadnt known that the Varanasi Central Jail had private rooms I went to meet Shuklaji in his cell. As requested I brought him three boxes of fruits two bottles of Johnnie Walker Black Label and a kilo each of salted cashewnuts and almonds. The cop who frisked me for security collected the parcel and promised to deliver it. I thought the M L A would meet me in the waiting area but I could go right up to his cell. H e sat in his room watching a small colour T V and sipping cola with a straw. GHETAN BHAGATNot bad eh he said. He spread his hands to show m e the fifteenbytenfeet cell. It had a bed with clean sheets a desk and chair closets and the TV. Yes it didnt seem awful It resembled a government guesthouse more than a jail However it couldnt be compared to Shuklajis mansion. Its terrible I said. He laughed. You should have met me in my early days in politics he said. I have slept on railway platforms feel so bad I said. I sat on the wooden chair. Six months maximum he said. Plus they get me everything. You want to eat from the Taj Ganga I shook my head. How is the carhe said. Great I said. College he said. Going okay We have slowed down a bit We dont have the capital I said. T will arrange the money Shuklaji promised. Take it easy Shuklaji. Keep a low profile. Things can wait I said. He switched off the TV. Your friend fucked us eh Shuklaji said. Hes not my friend. And he is finished now. And you will be back I said. They won t give me a ticket next time he said pensively. I heard I said. From who Shuklaji looked surprised. I told him about my friendship with Aarti the DMs daughter and what she had told me. I didnt tell him about her relationship with Raghav nor did I give details about her and me. Oh yes you have known her for long right he said. School friend I said. So her father wont contest Shuklaji said. I shook m y head. Neither will the daughter. She hates politics. So maybe you still have a chance I said.REVOLUTION Not this time Shukiaji dismissed. have to wait. N o t right after jail Theyll find someone else then The D M s family will definitely win he said. People love them. They arent interested I said. How close are you to her His sharp question had m e in a dither. I never lie to Shuklaji. However I didnt want to give him specifics about Aarti and me either. I kept quiet. You like her he said. Leave it Shuklaji. You know I am immersed in m y work I said evading the topic. I a m talking about work only you silly boy Shuklaji said. What I said amazed by how the MLA sustained his zest for politics even in jail. You marry her. If that brokenlegged DM can t contest and the daughter wont the soninlaw will What What makes you say that T have spent twentyfive years in Indian politics. It is obvious that is what they will do. Wait and watch they will marry her off soon. Her parents are pestering her for marriage. Marry her. Contest the election and win it I kept quiet. Do you realise where your GangaTech will be if you become an MLA I will be back one day anyway maybe from another constituency. And if b o t h of us are in power we will rule this city maybe the state. Her grandfather even served as CM for a while I havent thought about marriage yet I lied. Dont think. Do it. You think she will marry you he asked. I shrugged my shoulders. Show her mother your car and money. Dont take dowry. Even if the daughter doesnt agree the mother will. Shuklaji Me a politician GHETAN BHAGATYes. Politician businessman and educationist power money and respect perfect combination. You are destined for big things. I knew it the day you entered my office he said. Shuklaji poured some Black Label whisky into two glasses. He asked the guard to get ice. I kept quiet and sat thoughtfully while he prepared the drinks. Sure power is never a bad thing in India. To get anything done you need power. Power meant people would pay me money rather than me paying money to get things done. GangaTech could become ten times its size. Plus I loved Aarti anyway. I would marry her eventually so why not now Besides she had somewhat hinted at it. I let out a sigh. I fought my low selfesteem. Its okay Gopal I told myself. You are meant for bigger things. Just because you didnt get an AIEEE rank just because you didnt remember the molecular formula doesnt mean you cant do great things in life. After all I had opened a college lived in a big house and had an expensive car. Shuklaji handed me the drink. T can get the girl I said. Cheers to that Mr Soninlaw Shuklaji raised his glass. TJDusy I said. I had called Aarti at work. A tourist was screaming at h e r because thewater in his room was not hot enough. Aarti kept me on hold while the guest cursed in French. I can call later said. Its fine. Housekeeping will take care of it. My ears are hurting Aarti said rattled by all the screaming. You will own a college one day. You wont have to do this anymore. Its okay Gopal. I really like my job. Sometimes we have weirdos. Anyway whats up How did the dinner go Boring. I dozed off on the table when the fifth guy wanted to inform m e of the Pradhan familys duty towards the party Any conclusion on the ticket Its politics Director sir things arent decided so fast. Anyway election is next year. You said something when you were saying bye I said. I could almost see her smile. Did I she said. Something about your husband becoming the MLA Could be why she said her voice childlike. I wonder if I could applyI said. For the husband or MLA she said. I dont know. Whichever has a shorter waitlist I said. Aarti laughed. For husband the queue is rather long she said. I am a bit of a queue jumper I said. GHETAN BHAGATThat you are she said Okay another guest coming. Speak later T m going to visit Raghav soon. I have stopped talking to him she said. She didnt protest against my proposed meeting with him. I took it as her consent. IntentionallyI said. Yeah we had a bit of a tiff. I normally fix things up I didnt bother this time. Good I said. So whats the tourist saying Shes Japanese. They are polite. She will wait until I finish my call. Tell her you are on the phone with your husband Shut up. Bye. Bye I said and kissed the phone. I opened the calendar on my desk and marked the coming Friday as the day for my meeting with Raghav.I pressed the nozzle of a Gucci perfume five times to spray my neck armpits and both wrists. I wore a new black shirt and a custommade suit for the occasion. I put on my RayBan glasses and looked at myself in the mirror. The sunglasses seemed a bit too much so I hung them from my shirt pocket. I had taken the day off On Friday. Dean sir wanted to bore me with a report o f the academic performance of the students in the first term. I needed an excuse to get out anyway. Ail the best. Avoid hurt as much as possible Aarti had messaged me. I assured her that I would handle the situation well. From her side she had messaged him a we need to talk equivalent and he had responded with a not the best time message exactly the kind of stuff that irked her about him in the first place. I told my driver to go to Nadeshar Road where Raghavs place of work was. One could easily miss the Revolution office in the midst of so many autorepair shops. Raghav had rented out a garage. The office had three areas a printing space inside his own cubicle in the middle and a common area for staff and visitors at the entrance.REVOLUTION May I help youa teenager asked me. I am here to meet RaghavI said. Hes with people the boy said. What is this about I looked inside the garage. Raghavs office had a partial glass partition. He sat on his desk. A farmer with a soiled turban and a frail little boy sat opposite Raghav. The fatherson duo looked poor and dishevelled. Raghav listened to them gravely elbows on the table. Its personal I told the teenager before me. Does h e know you are coming No but he knows me wellI said. Raghav noticed me then and stepped out of his cabin. Gopal Raghav said surprised. If he was upset with me he didnt show it. Raghav wore a Tshirt with a logo of his newspaper and an old pair of jeans. He looked unusually hip for someone in a crisis. Can we talk I said. What happened Raghav said. MLA Shukla sent youcNoIsaid. Actually it is personal.Can you give me ten minutes he said. won t be longI said. I am really sorry. But these people have travelled a hundred kilometres to meet me. They have had a tragedy. Ill finish soon I looked back into his office. The child now lay in his father s lap. He seemed sick. Fine I said and checked the time. Thanks. Ankit here will take care of you he said. The teenager smiled at me as Raghav went inside. Please sit Ankit said pointing to the spare chairs. I took one right next to Raghavs office. I chatted with Ankit to pass time. Nobody else here I said.cWeh a d two more staff members Ankit said who left after theoffice was ransacked. Their parents didnt feel it was safe anymore. As it is salaries are delayed. GHETAN BHAGATWhy havent you left I said. Ankit shook his head. T want to be there for Raghav sir he said. Why I said. He is a good person Ankit said. I smiled even though his words felt like stabs. The office doesnt look that badI said. We cleaned it up. The press is broken though. We dont have a computer either. You did such a big story I said. They fired an MLA because of you guys. Ankit gave me a level look. Hie media ran with the story because they wanted to. But who cares about us How are you operating now I said. Ankit opened a drawer in the desk. He took out a large sheet of paper with handwritten text all over it. Sir writes the articles I write the matrimonials. We make photocopies and distribute as many as we can. How many I said. Four hundred copies. Its handwritten and photocopied obviously not many people like that in a paper. I scanned the A sheet. Raghav had written articles on the malpractices by ration shops in Varanasi. He had handdrawn a table that showed the official rate the black market rate and the money pocketed by the shopkeeper for various commodities. I flipped the page. It had around fifty matrimonials meticulously written by hand. Four hundred copies How will you get ads with such a low circulation Ankit shrugged and did not answer. I have to go to the photocopy shop he said instead. Do you mind waiting alone No problem I will be fine I said sitting back. I checked my phone. I had a message from Aarti Whatever you do. Be kind. I kept the phone back in my pocket. I felt hot in my suit. I realised nobody had switched on the fan. Wheres the switch asked Ankit.REVOLUTION No power sorry. They cut off the connection. Ankit left t h e office. I removed my jacket and undid the top two buttons o f my shirt. I considered waiting in my car instead of this dingy place. However it would be too cumbersome to call the driver again. I had b e c o m e too used to being in airconditioned environs. The hot room reminded me of my earlier days with Baba. As did for some reason the little boy in the other room who slept in his fathers lap. I looked again from the corner of my eye. The farmer h a d tears in his eyes. I leaned in to listen. T have lost one child and my wife. I don t want to lose m o r e members of my family. He is all I have the man said hands folded. Bishnuji I understand Raghav said. My paper did a huge story on the Dimnapura plant scam. They broke our office because o f it But you come and see the situation in my village Roshanpur. Theres sewage everywhere. Half the children are sick. Six have already died. Roshanpur has another plant. Maybe someone government there too Raghav said. But nobody is reporting it. The authorities are not doing anything. You are our only hope the farmer said. He took off his turban and put it on Raghavs desk. What are you doing Bishnuji Raghav said giving the turban back to the hapless man. T am a nobody. My paper is at the verge of closing down. We distribute a handful of handwritten copies most of which go into dustbins T told my son you are the bravest most honest man in this city Bishnu said his voice quivering with emotion. Raghav gave a smile of despair. What does that mean anyway he said. Tf the government can at least send some doctors for our children we dont care if the guilty are punished or not the man said. Raghav exhaled. He scratched the back of his neck before he spoke again. All right I will come to your village and do a story It will be limited circulation now. If my paper survives we will do a big one again. If not well no promises. Okay cheated the GHETAN BHAGATThank you Raghavji There was such hope in his eyes I couldnt help but notice. And one of my friends father is a doctor. I will see if he can go to your village. Raghav stood up to end the meeting. The man stood up too which woke up his son and bent forward to touch Raghavs feet. Please dont Raghav said. I have a meeting now. After that lets go to your village today itself. How far is it A hundred and twenty kilometres. You have to change three buses the farmer said.Takes five hours maximum. Fine please wait then. Raghav brought them the man and his weak and sleepy son outside theoffice. Sit here Bishnuji Raghav said and looked at me. Two minutes Gopal Let me clean up my office. I nodded. Raghav went inside and sorted the papers on his desk. The m a n sat on Ankits chair facing me. We exchanged cursory smiles. Whats his name I said pointing to the boy who was lying in his lap once again. Keshav the farmer said stroking his sons head. I nodded and kept quiet. I played with my phone flipping it up and down up and down. I felt for the duplicate Mercedes key in my pants pocket. I h a d especially brought it for the occasion. Baba will I also die Keshav said his voice a mere thread. Stupid boy. What nonsensethe farmer said. I felt b a d for the child who would not remember his mother when he grew up just like me. I gripped the key in my pocket harder hoping that clutching it will make me feel better. Raghav was dusting his desk and chair. His paper could close down in a week a n d he had no money. Yet he wanted to travel to some farflung village to help some random people. They had broken his office but not his spirit I clutched the key tighter to justify to myself that I am the better person here.REVOLUTION I realised the boy was staring at me. His gaze was light but I felt disturbed like he was questioning me and I had no answer. What have you become Gopal a voice rang in my head. I restlessly took out the sunglasses from my pocket and twirled them about. I suddenly noticed that the eyes of the boy Keshav were moving with the sunglasses. I moved them to the right his eyes followed. I moved them to the left his eyes followed. I smiled at him. What I pointed at my fancy shades. You want these Keshav sat up feeble but eager. Though his father kept saying no I felt a certain relief in handing over the sunglasses. They are big for me the boy said trying them on. T h e oversized glasses made his face look even more pathetic. I closed my eyes. The heat in the room was too m u c h . I felt sick. Raghav was now on the phone. My mind continued to talk. What did you come here for You came toshow him that you have made it and he is ruined Is that the high point of your life You think you are a better person than him because of your car and suitGopal Raghav called out. Huh I said opening my eyes. What Come on inRaghav said. I went into his office. I kept my hand in my pocket on my keys. According t o the plan I was to casually place the keys on his table before sitting down. However I couldnt. Whats in the pocket Raghav said as he noticed that m y hand would not come out. Oh nothing said and released the keys. I sat down t o face him. What brings you to Revolution Yeah I said. What Raghav said. I didnt know what to say. I had my whole speech planned. On how Aarti deserved better than him and that better person was I. On how I h a d made it in life and he had failed. On how he was the loser not me. A n d yet saying all that now would make me feel like a loser. Have we upset your bosses again Raghav chuckled. Oh wait you said it is personal. GHETAN BHAGATHows the paper I said saying something to end the awkward silence. He swung his hands in the air. You can see for yourself. What will you do if it closes down I said. Raghav did not smile. Havent thought about it. End o f phase one I guess. I kept quiet Hope I wont have to take an engineering job. Maybe I will have to apply . . R a g h a v s voice trailed into silence. I could tell Raghav didnt know. He hadnt thought that far. Im sorry Gopal Raghav said if I have hurt you in the past. Whatever you may think it wasnt personal. Why do you do all this Raghav You are smart. Why dont you just make money like the rest of us Someone has to do it Gopal. How will things change The whole system is fucked up. One person cant change it. I know. So We all have to do our bit. For change we need a revolution. A real revolution can only happen when people ask themselves what is my sacrifice Sounds like your newspapers tagline I mocked. He h a d no answer. I stood up to leave. He followed me out. I decided not to call my car but to walk out into the lane and find it. What did you come here for Raghav said. I cant believe you came here to check on me. T had work in the area. My car needed servicing. I thought I will visit you while i t gets fixed I said. Nice o f you to come. You should check on Aarti too sometimes he said. I went on redalert at the mention of her name. Yeah. How is she doing I said. Havent met her in a while but she seems stressed. I have to make it up to hen You should call her she will like it he said. I nodded and came out of his office.VI lay down in my comfortable bed at night. However I could not sleep a wink. There were three missed calls from Aarti. I didnt call back. I couldnt. I didnt know what to say to her. How did it go she messaged me. I realised shed keep asking until I told her something. I called her. Why werent you picking up she said. Sorry I had the dean at home. He left just now. You met Raghavshe asked impatiently. Yeah I sighed. So He had people in his office. I couldnt bring it up I said. Gopal I hopeyou realise that until I break up with him I am cheating on him with you. Should I talk to him No no wait. I will meet him in private And I need to speak to my parents too she said. About what T have three prospective grooms lined up for meetings next week. All from political families Have your parents gone insaneI exploded. When it comes to daughters Indian parents are insane she said. T can stall them but not for long. Okay I will fix thisI said. I pulled two pillows close to me. See this is what happens after sex. Roles reverse. The girl has to chase now. Nothing like that Aarti. Give me two days GHETAN BHAGATOkay. Else I am speaking to Raghav myself. And in case he asks nothing ever happened between us. What do you mean I said. I never cheated on him. We decided to get together but only did so after the breakup. Okay Okay I said. Sometimes I feel girls like to complicate their lives. He will be devastated otherwise she finished. I ended the call and lay down on the bed exhausted. My eyes hurt due to the extra white clothes people had worn for the funeral. I looked at people s faces. I could not recognise any of them. Whose funeral is it I asked a man next to me. We stood at the ghats. The body I saw was small. They took it straight to the water. Why are they not cremating it I asked. And then I realised why. It was a child. I went close to the body and removed the shroud. It was a little boy. In sunglasses. Who killed him I screamed but the words would not come out... I woke up screaming at the white ceiling of my bedroom and the bright lights I had forgotten to switch off. It was a m. Just a nightmare I told myself. I tossed and turned in bed but could not go back to sleep. I thought about Raghav. The guy was finished. His paper would shut down. He would find it tough to get a job at least in Varanasi. And wherever he was Shuklas men could hurt him. I thought about Aarti my Aarti my reason to live. I could be engaged to her next week married in three months. In a year I could be an ML A. My university approvals would come within the space of a heartbeat I could expand into medicine MBA coaching aviation. Given how much Indians cared about education the sky would be the limit. Forget Aarti becoming a flight attendant I could buy her a plane. If I played my cards right I could also rise up the party ranks. I had lived alone too long. I could start a family and have lots of beautiful kids with Aarti. They wouldREVOLUTION grow up and take over the family businesses and political empire. This is how people become big in India. I could become really big. But what happens to Raghav The deadalive Keshav asked me. I dont care I told him. If he went down it is because of his own stupidity. If he were smart he would have realised that stupid bravado will lead to nothing. There would be no revolution in this country by . There wouldnt be one by This is India nothing changes here. Fuck you Raghav But Keshav was not done with me. What kind of politician be Gopal T dont want to answer you. You are scaring me go away I said out aloud even though there was nobody in the room. Really I knew that. What about Aarti A voice whispered within me. I love her What about her Does she love you Yes Aarti loves me. She made love to me. She wants me to be her husband I screamed in my head until it hurt. But will she love you if she knows who you really are A corrupt manipulative startling me But are you a good person The clock showed a.m. Day was breaking outside. I went for a walk around the campus. My mind calmed a little in the fresh morning air. Little birds chirped on dewdrenched trees. They didnt care about money the Mercedes or the bungalow. They sang for that was what they wanted to do. And it felt beautiful. For the first time I felt proud of the trees and birds on the campus. I realised why Keshav kept coming to me. Once upon a time was Keshav sweet innocent and unaware of the world. As life slapped me about several times and thrashed the innocence out of me I had killed my Keshav for the world didnt care about sweetness. Then why didnt I crush Raghav completely yesterday Maybe that Keshav hasnt died I told myself. Maybe that innocent good part of us never dies we just trample upon it for a while. bastard T work hard. I am a successful man I said aloud again my voice will you GHETAN BHAGATI looked at the sky hoping to get guidance from above from god my mother or Baba. Tears streamed down my face. I began to sob uncontrollably. I sat down under a tree and cried for an hour. Just like that. Sometimes life isnt about what you want to do but what you ought to do.Shuklaji was eating apples in the jail verandah. A constable sat next to him peeling and slicing. Gopal my son come come Shuklaji said. He wore a crisp white kurtapyjama that glistened in the morning sun. I sat on the floor. Had a small favour to ask you I said. Of coursehe said. I looked at the constable. Oh him. He is Dhiraj from my native place. Dhiraj my son and I need to talk. The constable left. Ive told him Ill get him promoted Shuklaji said and smiled. I have come with a strange request I said. Everything okay Shuklaji can you help me hire some ... call girls You mentioned them long ago. Shuklaji laughed so hard apple juice dripped out of his mouth. T am serious I said. My boy has become big. So you want women Its not for me. Shuklaji patted my knee and winked conspiratorially. Of course not. Tell me how old are you T will turn twentyfour next week I said. Oh your birthday is coming he said. Yes on November I said. Thats great. You are old enough. Dont be shy he said we all do it. Sir it s for the inspectors. We have a visit next week I said. T want to increase my fee. They control the decision.REVOLUTION He frowned. Envelopes wont do it for them This one inspector likes women. I have news from other private colleges in Kanpur. Oh okay Shuklaji said. He took out his cellphone from a secret pocket in his pyjamas. He scrolled through his contacts and gave me a number. His name is Vinod. Call him and give my reference. Give him your requirements. Hell do it. When do you need them T dont have the exact date yet I said and began to stand up. Wait Shuklaji said pulling my hand and making me sit down again. You also enjoy them. It gets harder after marriage. Have your fun before that. I smiled absently. How is it going with the DMs daughter Good I said. I wanted to say bare minimum on the topic. You are going to ask her parents Or give her the love bullshit I havent thought about it I said. I have to go Shuklaji .theres an accounts meeting today Shuklaji realised I didnt want to chat. He walked me to the jail exit. Life may not offer you the same chance twice he said in parting. The iron door clanged shut between us. he calendar showed tenth November my last day as a twentythree yearold. I spent the morning at my desk. The students representatives came to meet me. They wanted to organise a college festival. I told them they could provided they got sponsors. After the student meeting I had to deal with a crisis. Two classrooms had water seepage in the walls. I had to scream at the contractor for an hour before he sent people to fix it. At noon my lunchbox arrived from home. ate bhindi dal and rotis. Alongside I gave Aarti a call. She didnt pick up. I had backtoback meetings right after lunch. I wouldnt be able to speak to her later. I tried her number again. Helloan unfamiliar female voice said. Whos thisI said. This is Bela Aartis colleague from guest relations. You are Gopal right I saw your name flash she said. Yeah. Is she there She went to attend to a guest. Should Task her to call you Yes please I said. Oh and happy birthday in advance she said. How did you knowI said. Well shes working hard to make your gift... oops What Maybe I wasnt supposed to tell you Bela said. I mean its a surprise. Shes making your birthday gift. Its so cute. Shes also ordered a cake ... Listen she will kill me if she finds out I told you. Relax I wont mention it to her. But if you tell me I can also plan something for her.REVOLUTION You guys are so sweet. Childhood friends no she said. Yeah so whats the plan Well she will tell you she cant meet you on your birthday You will sulk but she will say she has work. However after work she will come to your place in the afternoon with a cake and the gift. Good that you told me. I will he at home then and not in meetings I said. You work on your birthday she said. I work all the time I said. Is she back Not yet I will ask her to call you she said. But dont mention anything. Act like you dont know anything. Sure I said and ended the call. It was time. I called Vinod. Vinod I said. Whos this he said. I am Gopal. I work with ML A Shukla I said. Oh so tell mehe said. I want girlsI said. He cut the call. I called again but he didnt pick up. I kept my phone aside. After ten minutes I received a call from an unknown landline number. Vinod here. You wanted girls Yes I said. Overnight or hourly basis Huh I said. Afternoon. One afternoon. We have happyhour prices for afternoon. How many girls OneI said doubtfully. Take two Ill give a good price. Half off for the other one. One should be okay. Til send two. If you want two keep both. Else choose one. Done. How much What kind of girl do you want GHETAN BHAGATI didnt know what kinds he had. I had never ordered a call girl before. Did he have a menu S ... somebody nice I said like a total amateur. Englishspeaking Jeans and all he offered. Yes I said. Indian Nepali or white he said. Varanasi wasnt too far from the Nepal border. You have white girls I said. Its a tourist town. Some girls stay back to work. Hard to find but we can do it. Send me Indian girls who look decent. Who wont attract too much attention in a college campus. College Vinod said shocked. We normally do hotels. I own the college. Its okay. Vinod agreed after I told him about GangaTech and how he had to bring the girls to the director s bungalow. So when do you need them Two oclock onwards all afternoon till six I said. Twenty thousand he said. Are you crazyI said. For Shuklajis reference. I charge foreigners that much for one. Ten. Fifteen.I heard a knock on my door. Done. At two tomorrow. GangaTech on Lucknow Highway I whispered and ended the call. The faculty meeting Shrivastava said from the door. Oh of course I said. Please come in Dean sir. I asked the peon to place more chairs for our twenty faculty members. Students tell me its your birthday tomorrow Director Gopal the dean said. The faculty went into orgasms. Its fun being the boss. Everyone sucks up to you. Just another dayI said. The students want to cut a cake for you the dean sgid.REVOLUTION Please dont. I cant I said. The very thought of cutting a cake in front of two hundred people embarrassed me. Please sir said Jayant a young faculty member. Students look up to you. It will mean a lot to them I wondered if the students would still look up to me if they knew about my specifications to Vinod. They have already ordered a tenkilo cake sir Shrivastava said. Make it quickI said. Ten minutes right after classes end at one the dean said. The faculty meeting commenced. Everyone updated me about their course progress. Lets look at placements soon I said even though our passing out batch is two years away. Jayant is the placement coordinator the dean said. Sir I am already meeting corporates Jayant said. What is the response I said. We are new so it is tough. Some H R managers want to know their cut Jayant said. Director Gopal as you may know... the dean began but I interrupted him. HR managers want a cut if they hire from our colleges correct I said. Right sir Jayant said. Every aspect of running a private college involved bribing someone. Why would placements be an exception But other members seemed surprised. Personal payout gasped Mrs Awasthi professor of mechanical engineering. Jayant nodded. But these are managers of reputed companies she said still in shock. Mrs Awasthi this is not your department. You better update me on applied mechanics your courseI said. GHETAN BHAGATThe maids had prepared a lavish dinner with three subzis rotis and dal. I didnt touch it. I lay in bed and checked my phone. Aarti hadnt returned my calls all day. However I didnt call her again. I thought again about my plan. At midnight Aarti called me. Happy birthday to you Aarti sang on the other line. Hey AartiI said but she didnt listen. Happy birthday to you she continued to sing elevating her pitch happy birthday to you Gopal. Happy birthday to you. Okay okay we are not kids anymore I said. She continued her song. Happy birthday to you. You were born in the zoo. With monkeys and elephants who all look just like you she said. She sang like she did to me in primary school. Corny as hell but it brought tears of joy to my eyes. I couldnt believe I had made my plan. Somebody is very happy I said. Of course it is your birthday. Thats why I didnt call or message you all day Oh I said. What oh You didnt even notice did you she sounded peeved. Of course I did. Even my staff wondered why my phone hadnt beeped all day in office. I got off the bed and switched on the lights. Anyway I thought hard about what to give you who has everything. And I couldnt figure out. Oh thats okay I dont want anything. Maybe I will buy you something when we meet she said. When are we meeting I said even though Bela had told me her plans. See tomorrow is difficult I have a double shift. You wont meet me on my birthday I said.REVOLUTION What to do she said. Half the frontoffice staff is absent. Winter arrives and everyone makes excuses of viral fever Okay I said. I must say she could act pretty well I almost believed her. Happy birthday again bye she said. A number of birthday messages popped into my inbox. They came from various contractors inspectors and government officials I had pleased in the past. The only other personal message was from Shuklaji who called me up. May you live a thousand years he said. Thanks you remembered I replied. You are like my son he said. Thank you Shuklaji and good night I said. I switched off the lights. I tried to sleep before the big day tomorrow.Jtinough enough I said as the tenth student fed me cake. We had assembled in the foyer of the main campus building. The staff and students had come to wish me. The faculty gave me a teaset as a gift. The students sang a prayer song for my long life. Sir we hope for your next birthday there will be a Mrs Director on campus Suresh a cheeky firstyear student announced in front of everyone leading to huge applause. I smiled and checked the time. It was two o clock. I thanked everyone with folded hands. I left the main building to walk home. Happy birthday Aarti messaged me.W h e r e a r e y o u I asked. D o u b l e shift just started. she sent h e r response.Vinod called me at . My heart raced. Hi I said nervously. The girls are in a white Tata Indica. They are on the highway will reach campus in five minutes. Til inform the gateI said. You will pay cash Yes. Why you take credit cards I said. We do for foreigners. But cash is. best Vinod said. I asked my maids to go to their quarters and not disturb me for the next four hours. I called the guardpost and instructed them to let the white Indica in. I also told them to inform me if anyone else came to meet me. The bell rang all too soon. I opened the front door to find a creepy man. Two girls stood behind him. One wore a cheap nylon leopardprintREVOLUTION top and jeans. The other wore a purple lace cardigan and brown pants. I could tell these girls didnt find western clothes comfortable. Perhaps it helped them fetch a better price. The creepy man wore a shiny blue shirt and white trousers. These are fine he asked me man to man. I looked at the girls faces. They had too much makeup on for early afternoon. However I had little choice. They are okayI said. Payment I had kept the money ready in my pocket. I handed a bundle of notes to him. Til wait in the car he said. Outside the campus please said. The creepy man left. I nodded at the girls to follow me. Inside we sat on the sofas. T m Roshni. You are the client the girl in the leopard print said. She seemed more confident of the two. Yes I said For both of usRoshni said. Yeah I said. Roshni squeezed my shoulder. Strong man she said. Whats her name I said. Pooja the girl in the hideous purple lace said. Not your real names right I said. Roshni and Pooja or the girls who called themselves that giggled. Its okay I said. Roshni looked around.Where do we do it Upstairs in the bedroomI said. Lets go then Roshni said very focused on work. Whats the hurry I said. Pooja was the quieter of the two but wore a fixed smile as she waited for further instructions. Why wait Roshni said. GHETAN BHAGAT have paid for the entire afternoon. Well go upstairs when it is time I said. What do we do until then Roshni said a tad too aggressive. Sit I said. Can we watch TV Pooja asked meekly. She pointed to the screen. I gave them the remote. They put on a local cable channel that was playing Salman Khans Maine Pyaar Kiya. We sat and watched the movie in silence. The heroine told the hero that in friendship there is no sorry no thank you whatever that meant. After a while the heroine burst into song asking a pigeon to take a letter to the hero. Roshni started to hum along. No singing please I said. Roshni seemed offended. I didnt care. I hadnt hired her for her singing skills. Do we keep sitting here Roshni said at threethirty. If s okay didil Pooja said who obviously loved Salman too much. I was surprised Pooja called her coworker sister considering what they could be doing in a while. The movie ended at p.m. Now whatRoshni said. Switch the channel suggested. The landline rang at fourthirty. I ran to pick up the phone. Sir Raju from security gate. A madam is here to see you he said. Whats her nameI said. She is not saying sir. She has some packets in her hand. Send her in two minutes I said. I calculated she would be here in five minutes. Okay sirhe said. I rushed out and left the main gate and the front door wide open. I turned to the girls. Lets go up I said. What You in the mood nowRoshni giggled. Now snapped my fingers. You too Pooja or whoever you are. The girls jumped to their feet shocked by my tone. The three of us went up the stairs. We came to the bedroom the bed.REVOLUTION So how does this work said. What Roshni said. Is it your first time Talk less and do more I said. What do you do first Roshni and Pooja shared a look mentally laughing at me. Remove your clothesRoshni said I took off my shirt You too I said to both of them. They hesitated for a second as I had left the door slightly ajar. Nobody s homeI said. The girls took off their clothes. I felt too tense to notice any details. Roshni clearly had the heavier bustier frame. Poojas petite frame made her appear malnourished. Get into bed I ordered. The two surprised by my less than amorous tone crept into bed like scared kittens. You want us to do it Roshni asked trying to grasp the situation. Lesbian scene Wait I said. I ran to the bedroom window. I saw a white Ambassador car with a red light park outside. Aarti stepped out and rang the bell once. When nobody answered she came on to the lawn. She had a large scrapbook in her hand along with a box from the Ramada bakery. I lost sight of her as she came into the house.Y o u are a strange customer Roshni commented. Shh I said and slid between the two naked women. Roshni quickly began to kiss my neck as Pooja bent to take off my belt. I started to count my breaths. On my fiftieth exhale I heard footsteps. By now the girls had taken off my belt most expertly and were trying to undo my jeans. On my sixtieth inhale came the knock on the door. On my sixtyfifth breath I heard three women scream at the same time. Happy birt... Oh my God Aartis voice filled the room. Roshni and Pooja gasped in fear and covered their faces with the bedsheet. I sat on the bed looking suitably surprised. Aarti froze. The hired girls more prepared for such a situation ran into the bathroom. GopalAarti said on a high note of disbelief. Aarti I said and stepped out of bed. As I rebuttoned my jeans and wore my shirt Aarti ran out of the room. I followed her down the stairs. She ran down fast dropping the heavy gifts midway. I navigated past a fallen cake box and scrapbook to reach her. I grabbed her elbow as she almost reached the main door. Leave my hand Aarti said her mouth hardly moving. T can explain Aarti I said. said dont touch me she said. Its not what you think it is I said. What is it then I came to surprise you and this is how I found you. Who knows what... I havent seen anything anything more sick in my life Aarti said and stopped. She shook her head. This was beyond words. She burst into tears.REVOLUTION MLA Shukla sent them as a birthday gift I said. She looked at me again still shaking her head as if she didnt believe what she had seen or heard. Dont get worked up. Rich people do this I said. Slap She hit me hard across my face. More than the impact of the slap the disappointed look in her eyes hurt me more. Aarti what are you doing I said. She didnt say anything just slapped me again. My hand went to my cheek in reflex. In three seconds she had left the house. In ten I heard her car door slam shut. In fifteen her car had left my porch. I sank on the sofa both my knees useless. Pooja and Roshni fully dressed came down by and by. Pooja picked up the cake box and the scrapbook from the steps. She placed them on the table in front of me. You didnt do anything with us so why did you call a third girl Roshni demanded to know. Just leaveI told them my voice low. They called their creepy protector. Within minutes I was alone in my house. I sat right there for two hours till it became dark outside. The maids returned and switched on the lights. They saw me sitting and didnt disturb me. The glitter on the scrapbook cover shone under the lights. I picked itup. A tale of a naughty boy and a not so naughty girl said the black cover which was handpainted in white. It had a smiley of a boy and a girl both winking. I opened the scrapbook. Once upon a time a naughty boy stole a good girls birthday cake it said on the first page. It had a doodle of the teacher scolding me and of herself Aarti in tears. I turned the page. GHETAN BHAGATThe naughty boy however became the good girls friend. He came for every birthday party of hers after that said the text. The remaining album had pictures from all her seven birthday parties that I had attended from her tenth to her sixteenth. I saw how she and I had grown up over the years. In every birthday party she had at least one picture with just the two of us. Apart from this Aarti had also meticulously assembled silly memorabilia from school. She had the class VII timetable o n which she drew horns above the maths classes. She had tickets from the school fete we had in class IX. She had pasted the restaurant bill from the first time we had gone out in class X. She had torn a page from her own slam book done in class VIII in which she had put my name down as her best friend. She ended the scrapbook with the following words Life has been a wonderful journey so far with you. Looking forward to a future with you my soulmate. Happy birthday Gopal I had reached the end. On the back cover she had calligraphed G A in large letters. I wanted to call her that was my first instinct. I wanted to tell her how amazing I found her present. She must have spent weeks on i t . . . I opened the cake box. The chocolate cake had squished somewhat but I could make out the letters Stolen My cake and then my heart it said in white sugary icing with Happy birthday Gopal inscribed beneath it. I pushed the cake box away. The clock struck twelve. Your birthday is over Gopal I said loudly to the only person in the room.Even though I had promised myself I wouldnt I called Aarti the next day. However she did not pick up. I tried several times over the course of the week but she wouldnt answer. Once she picked up by accident. How are youI said. REVOLUTION Please stop calling me she said. am trying not toI said Try harder she said and hung up. I wasnt lying. I was trying my best to stop thinking of her. Anyway I ad a few things left to execute my plan. I called Ashok the Dainik editor. Mr Gopal Mishra he said. Hows the paper doing I said. Good. I see you advertise a lot with us. So thank you very much. T need to ask for a favour I said to the editor. What the editor said wondering if I would ask to suppress a story. want you to hire someone I said. Hes good. Who Raghav Kashyap. The trainee we fired the editor said. Your MLA Shukla made us fire him. Yeah hire him back. Why And he started his own paper. He did that big Dimnapura plant story. Sorry we had to carry it. Everyone did. I t s okay I said Can you rehire him Dont mention my name. The editor thought it over. T can. But he is a firebrand. I dont want you to be upset again. Keep him away from education. Rather keep him away from scandals for a while. Ill try the editor said. Will he join He has his paper. His paper is almost ruined. He has no job I said. Okay I will call him the editor said. I owe you one. Book front page for GangaTech next Sunday I said. Thank you I will let marketing know.A week after my birthday Bedi came to my office with two other consultants. They had a proposal for me to open a Bachelor of Management Studies course. Dean Shrivastava also came in. GHETAN BHAGATMBA is in huge demand. However that is after graduation. Why not offer something before Bedi said. The consultant showed me a presentation on their laptop. The slides included a costbenefit analysis comparing the fees we could charge versus the faculty costs. Business Management Studies BMS is the best. You can charge as much as engineering but you dont need facilities like labs one consultant said. Faculty is also easy. Take any MCom or CA types plenty of them availablesaid the other. I drifted off. I didnt care about expansion anymore. I didnt see the point of the extra crore we could make every year. I didnt even want to be in office. Exciting isnt itBedi said. Huh Yeah can we do it some other time I said. Why Bedi said. Then he saw my morose face. Yes we can come again he agreed. Lets meet next week. Or whenever you have time. Bedi and his groupies left the room. Director Gopal are you not feeling well the dean said. Im okay I said. Sorry to say but you havent looked fine all week. Its not my business but I am older. Anything I can help with Its personalI said my voice firm. You should get married sir. The student was right he chuckled. Are we doneI said. That cut his smile short. In an instant he stood up and left. My cellphone beeped. I had an SMS from Sailesh marketing head ofDainikR a g h a v a c c e p t e d t h e offer. H e joins t o m o r r o w . G r e a t t h a n k you very m u c h I replied. Hope our association becomes even stronger. Thank you forb o o k i n g S u n d a y t e x t e d Sailesh. he arrival of a black Mercedes in the Dainik office caused a minor lutter among the guards. A big car ensures attention. I stepped out and put on my new sunglasses. I went to the receptionist in the lobby. am here to meet Raghav Kashyap I said and gave her my business card. The receptionist couldnt locate him. Sailesh saw me from the floor above and came running down the steps. Gopal bhai You should have informed me. What are you waiting here for want to meet Raghav I said. Oh sure he said please come with me. We walked up to Raghavs cubicle. An IT guy crouched under his desk setting up his computer. Raghav had bent down as well to check the connections. You rejoined here I said. Raghav turned around. Gopal he said and stood up. I had come to the marketing department and saw you. I turned to Sailesh. Thank you Sailesh. Okay Sailesh said. See you Gopal bhai. After h e left Raghav said Tt s strange. The editor called me himself. I had no money anyway. Thought I will rejoin until I have enough to relaunch Revolution Sure h e said. We walked up to the staff canteen on the second floor. Framed copies of old newspaper issues adorned the walls. Dozens of journalists sat with Can we go for a cup of teaI said. GHETAN BHAGATtheir dictaphones and notebooks enjoying evening snacks. I could tell Raghav felt out of place. T m used to a small office now Dainik is huge he said. He bought two plates of samosas and tea. I offered to pay but he declined. Coginthewheel feeling eh I said. Not only that. The stuff we did at Revolution that here he said. The stuff you did at your paper I wanted to tell him led to premature bankruptcy. However I hadnt come here to put him down. Tts nice to have a job. Plus you like journalism said Thats why I took it. A sixmonth trial for now. Only six months They want me to edit other peoples stories. It is supposed to be more senior in title but I like being a reporter. Lets see. A job pays the bills. Of course it helps to be employed if you want to gt married I said. Raghav laughed. We hadnt talked about personal stuff for years. However he didnt doubt my goodwill. Thats the thing with Raghav. He could unearth the biggest scams but at another level he trusted people so easily. Whos getting married Raghav said still laughing. You and Aarti. Arent you said. I reminded myself I had to smile through this. Raghav looked at me. I had never discussed Aarti with him. In fact I hadnt discussed anything with him in years. I hope l ean talk to you as a friend We were once right I said. I took a bite o f the samosa and found it spicy as hell. Raghav nodded on a sigh. Things arent going so well between me and Aarti. Really I faked surprise. T havent spoken to her in weeks What happenedI said. Raghav squirted tomato sauce over his samosa. can never doREVOLUTION Its my fault. When the paper started I didnt give her enough time. Soon we drifted apart. The last couple of months she seemed so disconnected Raghav said. Did you guys talk about it I said No we planned to but didnt he said. She loves you a lotI said. I dont know Raghav said. He twirled his samosa in the sauce without eating it. She does. I know her from childhood Raghav. You mean everything to her. Raghav seemed surprised.Do I She wanted to marry you isnt it At the wrong time. Look at me I am nowhere with respect to my careerRaghav said. Your career is different from others. You cant measure it in money. In terms o f helping people you are doing quite well. I blew that too Raghav said. You are fine. You are a subeditor at a big paper. And if you marry Aarti you can go far. What do you mean You know theres pressure on Aartis family to enter politics I said. Raghav kept quiet. You do right T heard he muttered. So Aartis father cant and Aarti wont. Soninlaw maybe Raghav looked up intrigued. How you think man I rolled my eyes. Im not smart. So I have to make up for it in other ways. You are not smart he said. You d o love her I asked. Things arent okay between us he admitted. You can fix them I am sure. After all your charm worked on her the first time I said. Raghav gave a shy smile. GHETAN BHAGATDont call her. Go meet her at the hotel. Take an entire day off for her. Thats all she wants your time and attention. Shell return your love ten times overI said looking sideways. Raghav kept quiet. Promise me you will go I said and extended my hand. He shook my hand and nodded. I stood up to leave. I repeated Shuklaji s line. Life may not offer you the same chance twice. Raghav walked me to my car. He barely noticed the car though. Why are you doing this for me he asked. I got into the car. I rolled down the window. Aarti is a childhood friend. Besides Besides what Raghav said. Everyone has to do their bit I said as the driver whisked me away.I didnt keep in touch with Raghav after that. He called me many times. I either didnt pick up or pretended to be busy. One of the times I did pick up Raghav told me he and Aarti had started talking again. I told him I had inspectors in my office and hung up. I had sworn on Babas soul that I would never call Aarti. She didnt either apart from a single missed call at a.m. one morning. I called her back since technically I had not initiated the call. She did not pick it. The missed call and callback drama between men and women almost deserves its own user manual. I gathered she had made the call in a weak moment and left her alone. I invited the boring consultants back for the BMS programme talks. The plan made a lot of sense. We started the process to expand into business studies. We had a new set of government people who had to approve our plans and thus a new set of palms to be greased. We knew the business would be profitable. Millions of kids would be tested rejected and spat out of the education system every year. We had to keep our net handy to catch them.REVOLUTION I spent more time with the college faculty and often invited them home in the evenings. They worked for me so they laughed at my jokes and praised me every ten minutes. I couldnt call them friends but at least they filled the empty space in the house. Three months passed. We launched the BMS programme and with the right marketing filled up the seats in a matter of weeks. I rarely left the campus and did so only to meet officials. Meanwhile t h e case against Shuklaji became more complex. He told me the trial could take years. He tried for bail but the courts rejected it. Shuklaji felt the C M had betrayed him even as the party sent feelers that he could be released from jail provided he quit politics. I went to meet him every month with a copy of the GangaTech Trust accounts. One day Raghav called me when I was at home. I didnt pick up. Raghav continued to call. I turned the phone silent and kept it aside. He sent me a message Where r u Gopal trying reach u. I didnt reply at first. I wondered if his repeated attempts meant trouble like he had discovered another scam or something. I texted In meetings. Wassup His reply hit me like a speeding train.Aarti n I getting e n g a g e d . W a n t e d t o invite u p a r t y nxt S a t u r d a y .I couldnt stop looking at this message. I had wanted this to happen. Yet it hurt like hell.Unfortunately Im not in t o w n . But c o n g r a t u l a t i o n s I sent m yresponse wondering if I had put one exclamation mark t o o many. Raghav called me again. I avoided his call He tried two more times when I finally picked up. How can you miss our engagement he said. Hey a m in a faculty meeting I said. Oh sorry. Listen you have to come Raghav said. I cant. I am leaving for Singapore to explore a joint venture I said. What Gopal And why dont you ever call back Even Aarti says you are too busy whenever I ask about you. T am really sorry. I am busy. We are doubling our student intake in the next two yearsI said. GHETAN BHAGATYou will miss your best friends engagement Wont she be upset Apologise to her on my behalfM said. Raghav let out a sigh. Okay I will. But our wedding is in two months. On the first of March. Please be in town then. Of course I will I said and circled the date on the calendar. Til let you attend to your staff. Take care buddy Raghav said. Instinctively I composed a congrats message to Aarti and sent it. She did not reply. I looked around my big house as empty as my soul.O n March I booked a room at the Taj Ganga. The fourthfloor roomhad a little balcony with a view of the hotel pool and lawns. I had tossed the SIM card out of my phone two days ago. I had told my staff I had to go out of town. I stayed in my room the entire day I came to the balcony at eight in the evening. In the faint light of dusk I read the card again. Mrs and Mr Anil Kashyap companyInvite the pleasure of your Raghav with AartiFor the wedding of their beloved sonDO Mrs and Mr Pratap Brij Pradhari At p.m. On March . Poolside Taj Ganga Lawns VaranasiDMI could see the wedding venue downstairs. The entire garden area was littered with flowers and lights. Guests had started to arrive. In one corner the DJ was setting up the dance floor and testing music tracks. Along one side of the lawn were the food counters. Kids were jumping about on the two ornate chairs meant for the bride and groom on the small stage. The actual wedding pandal where the ceremony would be held was covered with marigold flowers. GHETAN BHAGATI stood there in silence listening to the shehnai faintly audible on the fourth floor. The baraat arrived at p.m. Raghav sat on a horse. The DJ increased the volume of the music. I watched from above as Raghav s relatives danced in front of the horse. Raghav wore a creamcoloured bandhgala suit. Even though I hate to admit it he looked handsome even from this distance. I would have worn something more expensive but still not looked so regal I scolded myself for making comparisons again. Aarti arrived at the venue at ninethirty. She walked slowly to the stage. A gasp of wonder shot across the crowd as they saw the most beautiful bride they had ever seen in their life. She looked like an angel in an onioncolored lehnga with silver sequins. And even though Ididnt have binoculars I could tell she looked perfect. During the ceremony cousins gathered around Raghav and Aarti. They lifted the couple making it difficult for them to garland each other. I couldnt bear it after the jaimala ceremony. I had wanted to see Aarti as a bride but I did not have to watch the whole wedding live. I came back into the room shut the door and drew the curtains. I switched on the T V at full volume to drown out the sounds coming from outside. I replaced the SIM in my phone. Messages popped in one after another as the phone took its first breath in days. I had forty messages from the faculty ten of them from the dean himself. Most o f them talked about various issues in the college. Raghav had sent me five messages asking me if I had received the card. I couldnt tell how many missed calls he might have made. One message startled me the most. It came from Aarti. It saidC o m e . But only if you w a n t t o .I thought about replying but remembered that she wont exactly be checking her phone on stage. I called the dean. Where are you Director Gopal the dean said in a highpitched voice. We are so worried Dean Srivastava ... Dean Srivastava ...REVOLUTION Gopal he said sensing the tension in my voice. Get me out of here I broke down completely. Where are you Where are you Taj Ganga ... I dont want to be here. T am cominghe promised. In an hour I was seated beside the dean in his car and on my way back to campus. So what were ... he began but fell quiet. He understood after one look at my face that I didnt want to talk. Dean Shrivastava I want to work hard. Lets take GangaTech to new heights. I want us to be present in every field of education. Keep me busy. So busy that I dont have time to think. You are already so busy sir. He looked troubled. More. Why arent we in coaching classes I said. Theres money there. I want a proposal for engineering and MBA coaching. Okay I said my voice ringing. Are you okay Director Gopal the dean said. Are you listening to me I want the proposal I said screaming loud enough to make the driver shift uncomfortably in his seat. Yes Directorthe dean said. He dropped me home. I went straight to the bar near the dining table. opened a new bottle of Black Label whisky wed bought for the inspectors. I poured it out in a glass to the brim. Neat. The maids filed in. Where were you sahib they said. had work I said. The whisky tasted bitter but I swallowed it all. Dinner I shook my head. The maids left the room. I went to the bookshelf and took out the scrapbook. I poured myself another glass. I drank half of it in one gulp but when my body rejected it I had to spit it out. I fell o n the floor. I used the scrapbook as a pillow and went off to sleep.lESfjp . o IiulijI checked the time. The hospital clock showed So getting drunk and crashing down is a habit said. Gopalgave me a sly smile. Tfmts the only time it happened he said Apart from tonight of y count J ww Copals face. He seemed young enough to look like a student Yet his face had the hard coating of experience of bitter lessons from life that made him appear older than his biological age eSoi arti and Ragha v got married a year ago i said H year and twenty days he said. What has happened since I said. Shukkifi is still in jail f meet him every month. J am trying to buy back his share of the college with my earnings and make it my own college. He needs money for hh other businesses. Lets see What about Raghav and Aarti I asked am not in touch I stay in my college. Elections am in two months. He is the one Meaningf Raghavs contesting His picture is on election posters all over the city Copal said. It could have hmn you. How do yu feel about that said. Gopal shrugged. Hell be a better MLA than me. What would I have done Made more money With him there is a chance he could change something lhat generous of you said opal sat up straight and restlessly removed the sheets off him. But I am still mi a good person right he saidREVOLUTION told you aw mrt worthy enough to be a hero in your story Gopal I kepi quiet could be the villain said Gopal his eyes spmkHng let ithe readers decide how they want to consider you. I simply write about people. I dont cast them as hemes or villains f said. Raghav is a good man. am not half as good as him Gopal Chehwp put your hand on your heart and tell me am a good i realised my approval meant a lot to him. Yet I wanted to I thought about it for a while. Target it sin Dont answer it Lets take a wallt z stroit tn off the bed. He seemed much better.
